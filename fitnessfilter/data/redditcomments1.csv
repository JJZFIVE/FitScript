I’m 48F and I’m having trouble with energy. I can workout just fine one day and then the next day or 2 I’m burnt out. I loved fitness and have tried everything to gain energy to workout. I have had numerous test to see what’s causing it and doc says I’m normal. Anyone who is in peri menopause or over 40 have any great ideas to get over this hump?,1
How does a small woman build muscle? Looking at dropping that body fat percentage and upping that bmr.,1
Currently have a desk job and work out 2 x 30 min weekly but I guess that's way too little?,1
Not intending to sign for a gym but I do have some dumbbells at home,1
"Thank you, very usefull!!!",1
"Recently when I go heavy at the gym,all I manage to do is fry my CNS and feel like 🗑 for 3 days. Why can’t I go heavy anymore? Heavy days used to to have me ready to attack",1
"Any tips for better engaging chest muscles? I'm currently following along on youtube chest workouts (press and fly variations, knee push ups) and while I feel some light tension in my chest, I don't really feel any sort of ""pump"" or ""burn"". Admittedly, my arms aren't always strong enough to hold the dumbbells in a perfectly controlled/steady manner, but my arm movements aren't jerkish or swinging.",1
"enough to hold the dumbbells in a perfectly controlled/steady manner,",1
Try the pec and cable fly machines. You can also look into using the smiths machine to do a Bench pin press. Where you actually let the bar drop down onto the safety bar each time and press up again.,1
Should I squat up to parallel or slightly below parallel?,1
"It depends, how good are your knees?",1
I’m doing a high volume workout.,1
Barbell squats - 40kg,1
Bench press - 40,1
Barbell rows - 40,1
Overhead press- 20 kg,1
Reps,1
"I always feel sore, my muscles are feeling tired. What am I doing wrong? Is 1 day rest between workouts not enough?",1
You should follow an actual program from the wiki,1
When should i increase weight?,1
When i can do all sets and reps of a set for e.g 3x8-12 and you do 3x12,1
Or when i can do more than 12 reps on a set for e.g if you do 13 reps on the first set and you can't do more,1
"As long as there's progressive overload it doesn't really matter how you get there, so whichever method is fine.",1
Are you talking about for assistance exercises? Compounds are almost always spelled out on how to progress but sometimes not the case for assistance exercises.,1
"You can progress by adding weight once you get to a certain amount of reps for each set like you say, or if that drops the rep count too drastically keep going for higher rep PRs.",1
Whatever your program says.,1
"Ok quick question. I’ve been reverse dieting for a month now adding 200 calories a week. I was eating 1,900 calories Im 208.8 lbs I started at 216 lbs. for the first 3 weeks my weight remained stable [lost around 2 lbs]. Than this past week I dropped down to 208. 70% of that weight in muscle according to my scale. I’m training 5 days a week. What gives? Macros are 40% protein 30% carb and 30% fat.",1
Scales are only accurate for telling you how much you weigh.,1
Sounds like normal variance honestly. Are you weighing yourself every day under the same conditions?,1
"I'm doing PPL, and I have superset of overhead extension + lateral raises and then superset skullcrushers + lateral raises... Should I change that skullcrushers? this is the same excersise as overhead extension I think? what should I change it to?",1
I would look at PPL’s designed by knowledgeable people like the one in the wiki.,1
Dips are great so that’s a good idea.,1
I was thinking about dips maybe?,1
"Knee is sore under the kneecap Maybe from plyos maybe from basketball but today is squat day, bad idea?",1
"Never take medical advice from Internet strangers, trust me if you saw me in real life you wouldn't think ""that's the guy I want assessing my injury""",1
"How long should you ""cycle"" pre-workouts? Beginning to feel like it's not hitting me anymore. Should I take a few weeks off?",1
Most of the reason people think a preworkout isn’t hitting is they’ve gotten used to the caffeine and beta alanine dosage. I’d stop taking it altogether for a week or two and see how you feel after that.,1
"Never used it, but with caffeine a lot of people do 6 weeks on 6 weeks off",1
"Hello All. I've (20M) been trying to learn the different obstacles for an OCR in september. I feel pretty confident about the running part of it, but I am having a really hard time with monkey bars. Does anyone have a recommendation on how to learn them?",1
"For the record, I am able to do ~5 pullups max, and can't hold with one hand at all on the bar, but I can last a good 30 seconds with both hands. Thanks so much for your patience and help :)",1
Do down to your local playground and practice them,1
OCRs are really fun! Practice on some of the specific exercices that you struggle with helps a lot. Do you have a nearby gym with a similar setup as monkey bars?,1
"You clearly already know this, but increasing your grip strength and pullup strength will benefit  you a lot. I have the opposite issue, I struggle with the running part.",1
"I'm looking at the Wiki and even though it says ""Dumbbell"" Stopgap PPL Frankoman’s ""Dumbbell only split"" both require you to have a bench. That is quite misleading, no? Are there any workout routines that are JUST DUMBBELLS out there?",1
"No barbells, no machines, no cables, etc. They're dumbbell programs.",1
You can do floor press instead if it's an issue.,1
"Just lie down on something that allows you to do the bench press motion in some way, or do a push up. This feels like a really minor thing that could be solved with a little common sense",1
You can just do dumbbell presses,1
Why are you writing your own programme instead of just following something proven and established?,1
"Just finished my second week working out. I'm a guy in their 20s for reference, never worked out prior to this. I am following a routine, and I've been solely using the machines. I just think I'm going to stick with them for the time being since they're so much easier for me.",1
I have two questions basically.,1
"First, for leg day, should my workouts be longer than the other days? I've been doing 3x8 for each machine that I need to do. Reason I ask is because I've noticed a lot of people spend an extra 30mins-hour on leg exercises.",1
"Secondly, is increasing the weight of what I'm lifting by five pounds per week reasonable enough?",1
since they're so much easier for me.,1
"That's why I recommend against starting with machines. They're easy in a way that makes it non-transferable to real strength. You're going to have to start to get used to doing and learning to do hard things, it's good for you. There is a such a wealth of knowledge online about how to do free weight lifts there's no excuse for not learning them",1
Leg exercises are usually more metabolically taxing. So you'll need a longer recovery period. There aren't any extra points for longer rests but there are extra points for getting more volume in. If you need the rest take it. If you don't do the next set. Or increase the weight so you'll need the set.,1
One more thing to note. A machine is not the same as free weights. Machines will not let you build your stabilizer muscles. So you can't graduate from a machine to free weights. You're better off starting free weights early and using machine for accessory.,1
What routine are you following? As long as you do the required volume in the routine then you should be fine.,1
"For your second question, a progression plan should already be incorporated in your routine. Follow the routine.",1
Perspective on size can be misleading in pictures. When you lose weight you get more muscle definition but shrink in total size.,1
It takes muscle to heft the weight around.,1
Also hypertrophy is possible during deficits contrary to the bro science.,1
Because their proportions change. Losing fat around the midsection makes the upper body look larger etc. And obviously their muscle definition improves.,1
Does anybody else here use pea protein powder? I picked some up on sale and am trying to figure out how to make it taste less awful. Suggestions appreciated?,1
"I put a vanilla flavored one in coffee. It still has the malty taste, but I like how that melds with the coffee.",1
"If you're living where it's winter I'm thinking insufficient Vitamin D might be a cause of the ED. You could try taking a vitamin D supplement and see it things improve in two weeks. The recommended dose is 6oo IU a day, but the optimal dose is probably closer to 2,000 IU. You're not even approaching an unsafe does until you're over 4,000. (The RDAs are not optimal doses, they're so you don't suffer deficiencies.) Low Vitamin D has a widespread effect, and ED can be one of them.",1
"Sleep, diet, and stress are also factors, so if your life is out of whack in some way that's going to contribute to problems functioning normally.",1
"Taking glutamine and protein powder are redundant, you only need protein powder--and you don't even need it if you're already getting sufficient protein in your diet. The suggestion that the protein is causing a problem sounds suspect to me, I don't believe your doctor would be telling you to stop eating chicken if you were having a chicken breast per day for protein instead of drinking a protein shake. Protein doesn't have any side effects, the only people who even have to worry about protein consumption are people who already have kidney problems. Eliminating protein, even if it's in powdered form, doesn't make sense.",1
Glutamine supplements are pointless. Also there is no real need for protein powder as long as you are eating enough protein at most a few hours before and after you workout,1
I’m not familiar with glutamine (or a doctor) but suggesting that protein could cause this is pretty wild…,1
"If i have two leg days in my split, is it better to do squats and deadlifts on both days or focus on squats one day and deadlifts on the next leg day?",1
I prefer doing them on seperate days since they're both axial loading and hinging movements. It helps with the fatigue management.,1
You can just do squats first on one leg day and deadlifts first on the second leg day.,1
Your routine should be telling you this.,1
How you train for accessories depends on your program. Generally though each set should be close to failure (1-2 RIR).,1
Alright guys I bought a go zone spin bike and I found a 40lb punching bag for myself I already have it hung up and well is this a good start to cardio and how long each day should I do each,1
"It depends on your goals Do what is challenging, but dont burn yourself out",1
In terms of Biomechanics/Form what did I do wrong on a deadlift that caused a pectoral injury. Felt a strain on the lock out portion. Day later bad bruising near the clavicular head and searing pain. Been about a week but absolutely terrified to do any upper body. Wasn’t even an absurd amount of weight for me.,1
Go to a physiotherapist and ditch the idea of form being the cause of injury,1
Does jogging burn the same amount of calories as running? How does one know if an exercise is moderate or light?,1
Heart rate monitor and how long you can sustain.,1
"Roughly walking all the way to running burns around the same calories per mile. The faster you go, more calories but not by a whole lot really.",1
"If you are looking for most calories burned, go with what you can sustain the longest. If you want to get better at running, build up to that and do that.",1
"As for moderate vs light ... In what sense really? Cus that's relative really. Someone well trained, a 3 mile jog/run may be some light cardio. For someone starting out, that'd be intense cardio.",1
How many sets a week should i work each muscle group? Im currently working around 20-25 sets for each a week. Is that too much? Or should I be doing more sets of a certain muscle per week compared to others? How much does it matter?,1
16-20 of hard sets per muscle group per week. But follow a routine.,1
"Good, but I’d recommend following a routine.",1
Nursing student here and was told that missing a certain amount of days will get me kicked out. I’ve been debating if I should cancel my gym membership since I can’t afford to get sick now. School and work. Do the positives of going to the gym outweigh the negatives? I just wanted some extra input to help me decide.,1
Being fit and active is better for your health and for your mind.,1
"Work on your nutrition and sleep as well to keep your immune system tip top. Youve got just as much of a chance of getting sick anywhere else. So imo, you may as well keep going to the gym.",1
"my body fat is 12%, why don’t I look like it? I still have some belly and ‘love handles’ (i have to add I don’t really have muscles yet, I just started working on muscles, in the past I was just reducing weight)",1
Probably because you’re under muscled or not actually 12%,1
is cheese a good source of protein and beneficial for building muscle?,1
"I’ve always eaten a lot of cheese. I know gran padana and parmigiano have loads of protein in it but i also eat a lot of sliced cheese, especially maasdammer and old gouda, but mainly to go with the beef or pork or chicken because although i know cheese has a lot of protein i was never sure of its quality contributing to building muscle.",1
Was just wondering.,1
Cheese is amazing,1
Cheese is good protein.  Enjoy.,1
"it is a good source of protein, and if you can digest it its beneficial to building muscle",1
Can semi-intense weight lifting while sick increase the risk of a respiratory infection or bronchitis?,1
For you or other people in the gym?,1
How do I improve my deadlift without actually deadlifting?,1
Do a lot of squats and rows.,1
"Strengthen your glutes, hamstrings, and back.",1
Block pulls?,1
You deadlift more. Avoiding deadlifting will not improve your deadlift.,1
Why don't you want to deadlift?,1
Would an armband tattoo on your forearm make it looks bigger or smaller?,1
I think it's neutral,1
"I can’t speak to the efficiency of the routine, but you seem to be hitting every body part, maybe even too much, except for your hamstrings. I don’t see any dedicated hamstring movements.",1
"Hi, I've been doing 5/3/1 with BBB for about 3 months now, but I've been having some trouble figuring out the AMRAPs. When I push myself to do more reps than the ""default"" number, I often can't do the assistance work afterwards and sometimes end up straining something and having to take a few days off to recover. When I leave a few reps in the tank, I don't progress. Does anyone have advice for knowing how many reps to do/alternatives to AMRAP-based progression?",1
If you are having that much trouble with the program I would back your training max of a lot. It's meant to be hard but it sounds like your TM is set too high.,1
"Wendler has addressed this in the newest book 531 Forever.  Many templates, including BBB are now done with 5s Progression, all 531 sets done for 5 reps, no AMRAP.  This allows you to focus on the supplemental work, BBB in this case.",1
"If you are enjoying 531, I recommend buying 531 Forever.",1
Weighing less than you look?,1
I’ve been training for 2.5 years and have exploited noobie gains. Recently gone on a long-term cut and feel like I should look a lot leaner for my weight. I haven’t lost much muscle on my cut as strength has stayed the same. I have a decent amount of muscle so skinny fat isn’t the issue?,1
"I’m 5”11, male and weigh 160lbs. I have faint ab definition. At this weight I feel like I should look leaner? Any ideas?",1
"In addition to what Fair Distribution said, you are probably pretty flat if you've been cutting for a bit and will look more full when you go back on maintenance or a bulk.",1
Any ideas?,1
I think this is very common.  Many people misjudge how much extra weight they carry.,1
i had to leave the gym early today because my grip was failing even with alternate grip. will doing grip strength exercises on rest days impact my recovery? im doing a modified version of this program: https://outalpha.com/the-out-alpha-novice-program/,1
"i just replaced back squats for box squats, conventional deadlifts for trap bar deadlifts, and rdls for sldls. the problem is at the end of my A days i have trouble holding onto the barbell for rdls (for reference my working weight is 225 lbs for ~10 reps) which really affects the amount of force i can exert with my legs. i dont want to use straps because i want my grip to be stronger",1
can i do dead hangs or farmers walks on off days without fatiguing myself on days i actually work out? specific rep ranges/volume per week would be helpful.,1
thanks,1
Your forearms are relatively small muscles and recover very quickly. You can absolutely train on off days with a grip trainer.,1
"And double what /u/Marijuanaut420 said. Get straps, grips, or something.",1
Don't let your grip be a limiting factor for posterior chain development. Train grip separately and use straps when necessary for other things.,1
"Call me crazy, but can a recent start in abdominal workouts cause absolutely bonkers sensations in that area? It isn't even DOMS - my lower abdomen feels like something was spilled (both cold AND warm) on my insides, as if I have gained consciousness over my intestinal peristalsis. Wtf???",1
"I think so.  Before I started regularly hitting abs, any direct ab work made me constantly run for the toilet with false alarms for the rest of the day.  Now that I do a modicum of ab work every training day and hit them harder semi regularly, it has mostly stopped.",1
Best convenient cardio for my needs?,1
"So, I’m a fit powerlifter, 21 years old, 5’8”, 170ish pounds. Not sure if it matters but my 1RM for bench, squat and deadlift is 250, 350, and 405 lbs.",1
"A few months ago I realized that even if I look good, I don’t want to die of heart disease lol, so I’ve been doing more cardio, and running Murphs every few weeks. I think it would be awesome to have a way lower resting heart rate, and mine is pretty dogshit genetically.",1
"I weightlift 5 out of 7 days, which I’ve been doing for the past 2+ years, so more recently I’ve been adding 30 minutes of cardio after every workout of the 5 days, alternating between incline walking (14 incline, 3 mph), and then steady state biking. That’s it. It obviously is a complete change compared to what I was doing months prior, which is little to no cardio, and also gets me to over 150 minutes of cardio per week.",1
"My question is, is there anything more efficient for my goals? My lifts can sometimes take 2+ hours, so sometimes I’m in the gym for 3 hours with cardio. I haven’t skipped a day at all, but I’m wondering if there’s something I could be doing instead that would still let me be heart healthy while prioritizing powerlifting.",1
"Shorter conditioning sets like sprints, prowler pushes, or crossfit wods might be more convenient. Especially because you can blast for 10 mins at the end of a workout and still get the desired stimulus.",1
Do cardio that you enjoy so that you want to do it.,1
"But an easy way to get cardio in for time efficiency... Get a spin bike or treadmill for at home and put it in front of the TV. Any time you would just be sitting watching, now you're biking or walking. Could even make it a game. If the show/movie is slow, you're going slow, but then when shit speeds up, you speed up.",1
"Cardio especially prolonged cardio will draw on your body's longer term energy reserves. As such, your body will be keen to replenish those reserves - which means food, especially carbs.",1
Are you sure your numbers are correct? 1800 calories is extremely low for someone your size.,1
Should I start adding like 250 calories to my daily total?,1
"If you are maintaining weight at 3200 calories per day, why are you adding calories?  Are you actively trying to gain weight at 305lbs?  I don’t think I am understanding you correctly.",1
What is your goal with this reverse diet?,1
"Best iOS app to measure average heart rate over a selected period (i.e., I can determine my average heart rate for the workout)? I have a heart rate monitor that sends the data to my iPhone, I just need an app that will let me check the average for only the period I want to check.",1
"Does your monitor sync with apple fitness? With my Apple Watch and my FitBit before it I could sync a ""workout"" with apple fitness and average heart rate is part of the data for any workout.",1
"Ideally, how many hours of sleep should a guy in his 20s get per night?",1
"Sleep cycles are 90 minutes each, which isn't evenly divisible into 8 hours, which is the common suggestion. So instead, one could sleep for 7.5 hours or 9 hours a night, because both are evenly divisible by 90 minutes. So which is better?",1
Omg enjoy sleeping while you can.,1
So which is better?,1
Not overthinking sleep to this degree would be a start.,1
"Get the recommended amount of sleep, i.e. 7-9 hours.",1
Don't worry about the 90 minutes windows. It's not precise and varies person to person night to night. Get as much sleep as you can.,1
"I'm doing PHAT right now, and I incorporated deadlifts into my lower power days along with squats. Should I also be doing deadlift speed sets along with squats on my lower body hypertrophy days, in that case?",1
"I don't see why not, as long as it doesn't affect the rest of the workout you should be good",1
"Has anyone here successfully got over lateral pelvic tilt: tight glutes, tight QL etc.,?",1
"If my plan told me to avoid cardio, I'd get a new plan.",1
What plan are you doing that avoids cardio? Sounds like a bad plan.,1
Do you mean you're going to the gym Monday-Friday?,1
what exercise can i complement my strength exercises on the inner week? (not cardio),1
What calories would you recommend for a 32 year old male who lifts weights 4 days a week and walks around 12KM a day. Setting around 215 pounds and looking to get down to 175-180.,1
"2500, and then adjust as necessary.",1
"Do you currently track your intake?  If so, about 500 calories less than maintenance.  If not, I’d start somewhere around 2000-2500 per day, track my weight for a few weeks and then adjust as necessary.",1
Foam rolling may provide some additional range of motion for a stretch but not foam rolling won't affect your long term recovery.,1
I would ask the PT/Physio who prescribed your current rehab protocol if and how foam rolling should fit into that picture.,1
What is the recommended training volume with glutes exercises for an intermediate lifter? I am planning on decreasing workload but i still would like to know an approximate number of weekly sets to have an idea,1
For what training goals?,1
10-20.,1
If you were going to do narrow stance squats as a supplementary exercise to low bar squats and focusing on strength. Would you be more inclined to do them sleeved or sleeveless? I'm thinking sleeveless so I can do as deep as possible.,1
I prefer sleeved squats because my knees gets slightly cranky if they get too cold.,1
Sleeves are kind of a pain so I never use them unless I'm going heavy,1
"is there any difference between pull-ups, chin-ups, or neutral grip chin-ups? I can only do neutral grip, the other ones are too hard. Do I use different muscles with them?",1
"Pull ups are often limited by teres major strength. Neural grip and chin ups (assuming narrow grip) will utilise the lats through their strongest range, a lot of people find neutral grip is easier on their elbows.",1
"Yeah pull-ups more lat activation. Neutral, a lot of hammer curl like bicep activation.",1
Chins use your biceps more. Pullups will generally be the hardest of those 3.,1
Good barbell only routine?,1
Pretty much any of the wiki routines.,1
"531, GZCL, most Stronger By Science programs, also almost all the popular novice programmes (stronglifts, starting strength, the r/fitness basic beginners routine except for pullups)",1
531 for beginners can be done with only a barbell.,1
"How accurate would Apple Watch calories be for a run? I want to get better at running but I don’t want to lose muscle mass for lifting so I’m going to eat back the most of the calories I burn and keep eating lots of protein, would this work?",1
I wouldn't trust calorie burn estimates from wearable tech,1
I’d track your weight and adjust your intake that way instead,1
"Ultimately, if you aren't losing weight, you're eating too much. So something isn't quite adding up right. I'd start by double checking all the food you're measuring out.",1
"You're miserable... Why? Is it the omad eating style? Is it the food you're eating? If you aren't losing weight, then you aren't really in a deficit so that shouldn't be affecting you.",1
What does your diet consist of? How different is this from your normal eating? How much water are you drinking a day? Are you on any medications?,1
Is this enough time to determine that it's not going to work?,1
"What do you mean by this? You asking if you won't be able to lose weight? Cus you don't defy the laws of physics, you CAN lose weight. It's just finding a way that leaves you happy and satiated",1
If your weight has not gone down at the rate you want I would adjust your intake. Are you eating back the calories the treadmill estimates? Are you weighing yourself every day under the same conditions?,1
Really need help picking a new pre workout.,1
I like Alpha Lion Extreme.,1
"What are you trying to achieve with a pre-workout product? Most do relatively little for performance in the grand scheme of things. I prefer more of a pump product heavier on ingredients like L-citrulline, some prefer a stim product. What are you looking for?",1
Coffee.,1
"Hi, so my main goal is growing my glutes. I train 5 days a week. I actually have 2 leg days. Should I increase it to 3 days? Will it be excessive?",1
3 leg days a week is not excessive if that's your main goal,1
Check out the sidebar for how to request a routine critique. Nobody will give you useful advice based on what you posted unfortunately. Doing a complete well designed program will get you the best results. There are lots of good options in the wiki,1
Would you say about 12-14 sets of chest excercises a week is good enough to build muscle / for hypertrophy?,1
I'm doing PPL,1
Push A: Bench Press Dumbbell chest fly (switch every week between flat and incline),1
Push B: Dumbbell chest press Machine chest fly,1
"12-14 sounds fine, but if you want to know your program is effective I would do one designed by someone knowledgeable. There’s a great PPL in the wiki",1
"I decided to stop doing barbell squats due to a medical condition in my foot (diagnosed), I’m physically unable to hit parallel with weight (I will fall backwards). It’s the only squat variation at my gym, what should I replace it with? Leg press? Only other exercise I have rn that hits the same spots is leg extension",1
Bulgarian split squats if you can do those,1
Leg press is fine if you are cleared by your doctor.,1
"How can I take control of my life, everytime I make a commitment or say to myself I'm going to start running or just anything I always back out of it and just like down. Because of this I'm overweight and feel like I'm never making any progress when I do try, I don't know what to eat or what to do. If someone could help I would be so grateful",1
I've had a few ups and downs with weight.  The easiest way for me to get back into eating better in particular (most of your weight loss happens here) is to focus on ADDING food to my days.,1
"I am a massive fan of the microwavable steamable veggies.  I start by forcing 1/2 bag (that's roughly 5 oz), per day.  Try to hold that for like a week.  Then move to the whole bag per day.  Next week, if I haven't been eating enough protein I force at least 1 meal to have a large portion of a leanish meat (chicken thighs are pretty lean without skin, sirloin steak etc, you don't have to choke down dry chicken breast or anything).  Next week a second large portion of protein.",1
"I find that around 4 weeks in, I felt like I haven't seen any progress, weight is only a few pounds down, but my clothes fit way better, I feel better, more energy, etc.  For the duration of this, just try to fit in a regular time for whatever exercise you prefer.",1
"Now, one month in, you have the framework for what it takes to continue on this path. Eating fairly healthy, more veggies than like 90% of people eat, enough protein to build muscle.  I tend to oose weight because the veggies and protein are way more filling than whatever I was eating before.  Even if I eat some less healthy stuff, it won't be as much as I ate before.  Tweak from there.",1
"Try to remember, if you are significantly overweight, it took a long time to get there, and will take a long time to get it off.  Even if it's only several pounds, building a healthy lifestyle is the only way to keep off whatever you lose.",1
"Tracking and weighing your food, busting your ass every day at the gym, those can come later if you want.  Just get started, keep at it, and see where it takes you.",1
"Small steps with exercise. Don't pick a routine of exercise that seems unrealistic. If you can even manage 10-15 mins of jogging and find that's your sweet spot in terms of A) convincing yourself to get out there without too much dread or boredom B) not getting too exhausted, then you go for that. Don't do half hour. This is just an example but you get my point. An even better thing would be to find a sport you enjoy as that won't feel like a chore to routinely do. Always remember something is better than nothing and a consistent routine of small steps are better than rare inconsistent large steps.",1
"Losing weight is about diet mainly so while it's good you try exercise, place great importance on this. Read/listen and learn to the science of it all as much as you can. Also learn what healthy meals/foods you enjoy eating. You have to enjoy it to an extent. It's all well and good saying you will eat chicken/broccoli every meal as you think that's the healthiest way to go about it.....but is it realistically going to last? Nope, you are human and you will get sick/bored of such mundane stuff. The more you know about nutrition, the better. Then you can start making a plan as to what your meals will be each day and make a routine of that too.",1
"Check out the wiki and read the sections that are relevant to you. Set easy goals at first. Go for a few walks in a week, cut out a few sodas, etc. If you change a ton of stuff at once it’s harder to stay compliant.",1
Unfortunately it’s very simple but not easy. You just have to want the result more than you dislike the process.,1
"Is there such thing as a lower back “pump”? I added Reverse Hypertensions to my routine, and ensure I initiate with my glutes first on each rep. But I get this almost pump-like feeling in my lower back as well that’s hard to describe. Just want to know if this is “normal”.",1
There are muscles there so yes,1
What are average conversion ratios for dumbbell/barbell press? Or flat and incline? What about seated dumbbell or standing barbell overhead press?,1
None are more useful than just going and doing the lift until you find an appropriate weight.,1
Can someone explain to me what’s wrong with a ppl split and why I’m seeing so much anti ppl propaganda (I mean this in the loosest sense of the word) lately,1
Lots of people run bad programs with PPL as the split.,1
"There's nothing fundamentally wrong with it, but in my experience it is often less effective than traditional 3-4 day strength programmes.",1
"For one, most people don't understand the difference between a split and a programem anyway. PPL is a fine format if structured properly, but most people don't follow any kind of structured progression and end up spinning their wheels.",1
It's also worth noting that PPL is designed as a method of maximizing recovery for someone who is training 6 days a week.,1
But most people (especially beginner/intermediate) will not and arguably should not train 6x a week anyway.,1
"It's also arguable that's 6x a week lifting is actually counterproductive for most people anyway, because it reduces the intensity you see capable of and you'll just end up doing lots of low impact accessory work.",1
"531 and GZCL and other similar programmes prefer 4ish days of lifting and 1-2 days of conditioning, and anecdotally they have made many more people strong.",1
"I don’t think it’s anti-PPL specifically, it’s just anti-bad programming. PPL seems to be what beginners gravitate towards as a hypertrophy template and beginners don’t know how to program effectively.",1
"I've been following the beginner routine of the sub for the past months (more than 3) while bulking and did some good progress, reaching my max on all lifts except deadlift. Now I'm about to start a cut and was wondering if i should keep doing the same routine or change to a non-beginner one. I just want to retain the muscle I've built.",1
I’d stick on a linear progression program as long as you can. If you stall you can swap to something like 531 for beginners that is not an LP program.,1
Currently: 32 F/5”4’/155lbs at 38% body fat (InBody scan),1
"I’ve been on a body recomp since 10/31/22. I’ve been between 154 and 157 since then, this is part of a 16 week training program so I’m pretty frustrated since I’m in the last five weeks at this point and haven’t changed much visually. I’m not sure if I need to keep going or try something different since the fat I have bothers me so much.",1
"Starting macros were 1500 119p/158c/53f (30%, 40%, 30%)",1
"Current macros are 1750 153p/132c/68f. (35%, 30%, 35%)",1
"I’ve lost inches and gained muscle. That’s cool! But my body fat has only changed maybe a percent. I still have 30lbs of body fat I want to lose, and I’ve been hovering around 38% body fat. I’ve asked my coach what to do and they’ve said to continue this for 2-3 months before maybe trying a cut. I don’t have a goal weight, but I figured I’d get down into the 140s by now.",1
"I’m getting stronger but I’m concerned that there hasn’t been more fat loss. Trainer has me doing weight training 5x per week, one of those days might have a few minutes of cardio but that’s it. I’m frustrated since after 16 weeks of working hard I’m not seeing much of a transformation. Should I give this recomp more time? Should I try something different?",1
"Recomp, by definition, will not have you losing weight. If you want to lose weight, you have to eat at a deficit. You also need to realize that changes aren't going to happen that fast -- try five months rather than five weeks.",1
"Scans aren’t super accurate with body fat percentages, so don’t put too much stock in those. A couple % difference is within the range of error so it’s not telling you much either way.",1
Recomps are pretty much always slow. If I were in your place I’d just go ahead and do a cut with a small deficit. But that’s up to you!,1
"Recomp is incredibly slow and that’s the main reason most people get frustrated. You’re not operating in a caloric deficit so your body will not readily use its fat stores as energy. As you’ve seen you’ve lost a little fat, but that’s pretty normal while trying to recomp. Cutting and bulking is almost guaranteed to get you to your goal physique faster.",1
16 weeks is also very little time in the grand scheme of things. In my opinion I’d go on a cut for 8-10 weeks while shooting for a pound of weight loss a week and then decide where to proceed from there.,1
"What is a reasonably cheap, but effective home gym that I can buy without a car? I have a 500 square foot room in my basement that I would like to use as a home gym.",1
"I don't have any specific fitness goals in mind, but I am worried about doing things ""correctly"" in terms of things like balancing ""pull"" and ""push"" exercises. In general, I probably want to get all my lifts to the equivalent of benching two plates.",1
"I don't have a specific budget in mind, but I would like to spend under $2000. I'm willing to spend more if necessary, but also if I can get an effective home gym for $200 then obviously I don't want to spend $2000 to get something ""nicer"".",1
"just to note, if you wanna go the cheap route it's possible to browse fb marketplace for like a full gym that will suit your needs and be like ""I'll pay $100 over asking for delivery"".  worth a shot if you want to go super cheap.  just a lot of patiently waiting which is annoying.",1
"You can do a ton of stuff with a barbell, plates, half rack, and bench. r/Homegym is great for specific brand suggestions. Without a car you’re better of ordering online. The beginner programs in the wiki can be done with minimal  equipment.",1
"Let’s say you eat just over maintenance calories per day, get the recommended protein intake each day, and your workout is optimal.",1
What difference would doubling your protein intake have on hypertrophy?,1
"Basically, I’m trying to ask with all other factors optimal, what does increasing protein do for muscle growth",1
It depends what you mean by recommended protein intake so I'll assume you mean >1.6g/kg . There seems to be quite a lot of individual differences in responses to protein intake; there are often outliers (a small minority) in trials who have bigger muscle protein synthesis responses to larger protein intakes. So it depends where about on the bell curve you lie as an individual. There are so many factors involved in gaining lean mass that making predictions gets very messy.,1
Ive tried very high protein diets in the past and it didn't change much for me at all. Except for giving me some GI issues,1
How do I lose body fat while maintaining muscle? How can I maintain protein intake when trying to eat healthy?,1
I’m at 30.5% bodyfat and 95.2 kg.,1
I fucked up my diet by eating fried foods and doing cheat meals.,1
"It is not easy eating healthy all the time. Food is fucking delicious, especially fried.",1
I’m trying to eat healthier.,1
Here’s what I’m eating after reducing friend foods:,1
I’ll drink protein milk with whey powder which around 30-35 g protein per shake (2 shakes a day),1
"I eat 2 bananas a day, rice, canned tuna, sunny side up eggs.",1
Then I’ll eat protein bread with scrambled eggs with onions.,1
I now try to walk 30 mins at an inclined treadmill everyday.,1
Eat sufficient protein while in a calorie deficit and train hard enough to maintain muscle mass. It's quite simple but not easy. Tracking calories makes maintaining a deficit easier and getting enough protein measurable. Follow a good program to train well.,1
"It’s often over complicated, but it’s as simple as eating adequate protein (0.8-1g of protein per lb of bodyweight) and doing a well designed strength training program. All the routines in the wiki are good.",1
At 30%bf you can base your protein target on your goal weight.,1
"Your diet sounds fine aside from a lack of vegetables. Chicken, beef, pork, and fish are all viable options for protein as well. The vast majority of my protein comes from ground beef and chicken thighs. For carbs I eat white rice or potatoes, and I throw a few eggs on top alongside spinach or bell peppers.",1
How do I lose body fat while maintaining muscle?,1
Eat in a calorie deficit while following a good lifting program.,1
"Why is it that we feel so good after working out, but many times it is hard to get motivated to work out? Usually I'm excited to train but there are so many days when I have to force myself to do it. After I always feel great and never regret doing a workout. As a matter of fact, in order to motivate myself to workout I usually have to think of how I will feel AFTER the workout.",1
Just wondering if there is a name for this or if anybody else has similar experiences,1
"It’s definitely common, but I don’t think there’s a name for this phenomenon. Unless you mean more generally, then behavioral inertia?",1
"I'll be starting the dumbbell ppl routine at my apartment gym to start out. We have a smith machine, a cable machine, leg press & leg extension/hamstring curl machine. What dumbbell workouts can I replace with machines?",1
At that point I’d do the regular PPL and just do the compounds on the smith machine,1
"Resistance bands are silent, as are dumbbells",1
That's just what nipples do,1
"Here’s the phrak’s GSLP I plan on doing with added accessories (abs, calfs, curls):",1
Day 1:,1
3x5 OHP / bench press (alternate),1
3x5 chin-ups / barbell rows (alternate),1
3x5 squats,1
2x10-12 curls,1
2x10-12 ab workout,1
Day 2:,1
3x5 OHP / bench press (alternate),1
3x5 chin-ups / barbell rows (alternate),1
3x5 deadlift,1
"1x15-20 Calf raises (slow, painful)",1
Day 3:,1
3x5 OHP / bench press (alternate),1
3x5 chin-ups / barbell rows (alternate),1
3x5 squats,1
2x10-12 curls,1
2x10-12 ab workout,1
Question: do the accessories look right or would you change their #s / frequency?,1
I’m going off the plug-ins page in his book.,1
"Thise accessories look great. You can do more sets if you want, but it doesn't matter than much",1
"I've been seeing a huge uptick in food products with added protein in my local supermarkets - yogurts, puddings, mousse, and even cookies and coffee. I'm drinking a protein coffee right now with 25 grams of protein per can and no added sugars.",1
"My question is - are these products as efficient in providing protein, compared to natural food (meats, legumes, etc) or powders? They're not that expensive, and I like mixing up my sources of protein.",1
"In terms of protein, it's all just protein. In terms of overall nutritional value, I think it goes without saying that puddings and cookies are pretty different than having some beans.",1
These products are just cashing in on the protein craze the last few years. They're almost certainly more expensive than just eating regular food but if they're within my budget I enjoy them as an occasional treat.,1
They're basically adding protein powder to the food.,1
"I'm an advocate of eating majority whole food and limiting/eliminating ultra processed food products. If you want to vary your protein sources, have different whole food sources as they are more beneficial to your health.",1
"Though if you want a sweet treat, having something that contributed to your protein goals as well isn't a bad idea, but I would not make any of these products a regular occurrence in my own diet. (And it'll save you money and save the extra trash)",1
"I saw Gatorade with added protein, tried it had a funky taste.",1
"Hey, I'm on 5314B and struggling to find a good assistance work scheme. Below is what I currently came up with. What do you think? I'm training calves every training day currently to give them a boost as they look weak compared to my upper legs. I try to focus on single leg/arm exercises to work out any differences.",1
"DAY 1 (squat/bench): pull-ups, dips, good mornings, single calve raise",1
"DAY 2 (DL/OHP): seated cable rows, incline DB press, single leg ext, single clave raise",1
"DAY 3 (bench/squat): lat pull-downs, dumbbell curl,DB straight-leg deadlift, single calve raise",1
I see zero problem with these.,1
"Anyone else here finding the bulking tough mentally? I'm 2 months into my bulk, and it is far easier for me to be cutting than bulking. But its part of the process. :P",1
It's so ironic.,1
I spent the first couple of decades of my life overweight and hated it. Losing weight felt impossible.,1
"Fast forward to now, where losing weight is trivially easy, but gaining is so difficult. Wtf body",1
"It's common, especially the longer you go on in a bulking phase.",1
Tough it out.,1
"Yep, I just plan my bulks to be much slower",1
Yeah im only at a 300 caloric surplus.,1
"Yes, I find bulks much more difficult",1
Any tips for bracing with OHP? I think I slightly overextended my back yesterday and have some soreness in the lower back. I don't seem to have problems bracing for other lifts. What are your cues for the OHP?,1
"Clench your cheeks, don’t know why, but it helps keep my back straight",1
Getting my head under the bar at the top helped me stopped swaying back and over extending. Improved my strength at lock out as well,1
Definitely squeeze your glutes hard to take pressure of your lower back.,1
Check out Brian Alsruhe on youtube for a thing bracing/OHP related. He has a ton of helpful stuff on both,1
https://youtu.be/PLHY2-nt-y4,1
https://youtu.be/NGkLOEEJVME,1
Thanks for the videos!,1
"Wanted to thank you again for the videos. I tried this for squats today, and my 1+ week weight felt easy--game changer!",1
I'm glad you found them helpful!,1
"Rows on deadlift day on fitness basic beginner feels like my lower back is gona die, is there a reason you do both on the same day or could I just switch the program around a bit so I'm doing pull downs on deadlift days",1
You only really need to use your lower back and your core to stabilise yourself during rows so it shouldn't be too fatiguing.,1
You might be putting too much of your lower back into your rows and or using too much weight.,1
I like the Pendaly Row because it's a much simpler movement and puts less strain on your back while been a lot of fun and great for explosiveness.,1
"I gave the pendlay row a go, I did like it but I don't feel like my flexibility is at a point where I should be rowing from the ground yet",1
You can do pull-down instead of rows if you’re too fatigued.,1
The more important thing is to do some form of upper back pulling motion,1
"Still planning on doing rows 3 times over the 2 weeks and pulldowns 3 times over the 3 weeks, I was just going to rejig it so I'm not rowing on deadlift days",1
"How is your bracing and form?  I always do barbell rows after deadlifts and neither really taxes my low back.  If anything, my hamstrings are more of an issue on the rows.  The break through for me was getting a good brace and keeping my upper back tight, that took the strain off of my lower back.",1
"Also, consider backing off the weight, go lighter with more reps and work your way to heavier sets once you get the form and bracing down.  Going too heavy too soon doesn't allow for an opportunity to learn the movement properly.",1
You can swap them.,1
"Personally the combo of chin ups, overhead press, and deadlifts on the same day have always been a personal favorite.",1
"What are some good, simple tips for someone wanting to join the gym after a loooong hiatus and gaining a lot of weight?",1
"I used to go to the gym 3-4 times a week when I was about 21, I’ve always been overweight but I lost 4st, got my fitness and health into good standing and genuinely enjoyed it.",1
"However due to events I fell into a really bad depression, did not deal with it and in about 9 years I’ve gained almost 13 stone, ballooned up to a total of 31 stone, my mental health declined massively and I basically let myself ruin my life.",1
"Late last year a few things brought me out of it after all this time and I pretty much immediately jumped into sorting my shit out, eating better alone, even with the Christmas calories and new years binge I’ve still managed to drop just over 2st in 4 months and I’ve got myself into a good routine with tracking calories and maintaining my personal health.",1
"Ive wanted to start going to the gym for a bit and started looking at actually joining the gym again 2 days ago, but I’ve been a little nervous considering I’ll be the 30 year old fat guy joining in January with people almost willing me to quit and stop hogging their machines!",1
"Today a co-worker coincidentally told me he was about to rejoin a gym and it turns out it’s the same one I’d be attending as it’s about halfway between both of us, which really secured my motivation to go back as now there’s even more accountability to keep me attending, so I’m going to call Monday and make an appointment to talk to someone and sign up, but I was hoping to get a few tips and ideas before heading over to get myself a bit more knowledge!",1
Thanks in advance ❤️,1
The wiki linked above is full of great information for beginners.  You should read it and pick one of the recommended programs to follow.,1
What makes front squats harder than back squats? I can do 300x5 on the back squat. I struggle with 205x5 front squats. Is it just a question of more time and more reps till I can get it up? Or is it always going to be much lower than the back squat number?,1
What makes front squats harder than back squats?,1
Different leverages/mechanical disadvantage.,1
"Your front squat will always be lower than your back squat. Usually there is a higher range of motion, the front rack position is more fatiguing to the upper back, and there is less posterior chain involvement. Olympic weightlifters have a FS/BS ratio of about 85% to 90% and they front squat a lot. If you want your FS to go up then FS more.",1
"More demanding of quad, core, and upper back strength.  If you dont have the proper front rack mobility, the bar near your throat may mess up your breathing at the bottom position.",1
"Not necessarily super fitness related, but I've been wanting to replace my sugary cereal with a healthier option. Literally all (seemingly) better options are muesli that include dried fruits or nuts, which I am allergic too. I haven't found any without added raw ingredients that I can't eat. I'm guessing it would be boring with only grains, so does that even exist? Apart from eggs and oatmeal, which I bring to work, what other kinds of healthier breakfast options could I try?",1
Might want to just consider eating 'non-breakfast' foods for breakfast.,1
Most of the foods that have been popularized and marketed as specifically breakfast foods (asides from what you have already mentioned) are kind of devoid of nutritional density.,1
You could just not eat cereal for breakfast.,1
But something like wheaties is probably up your alley.,1
"I swapped from eating oats to a Protien flapjack which is pretty much oats, peanut butter, and whey.",1
I also have a nut allergy and just have oats for breakfast. I have never been able to find another 'healthy' cereal either.,1
Greek yogurt?,1
"Yogurt is good, I'll also eat my dinner leftovers for breakfast the following day",1
Cornflakes.,1
I thought those were loaded with sugar? There are versions that can be called healthy?,1
You're thinking of Frosted Flakes. Different cereal.,1
"I'm still on my first even cut but I'm already gathering some information on the bulking process for in a couple of weeks. My question is: if I fall short on calories on one day, is it wise to just drink some chocolate milk to get the calorie surplus in for the day? As of now I'm not too worried about it but good to know that kind of stuff anyway.",1
"Maybe this is a dumb question I should save for Monday, but any specific lifts or methods for growth in my forearms?",1
"I’ve had the best progress by doing heavy farmer walks, deadlifts (no straps), and pull ups/dead hangs.",1
"There are a wide range of forearm-specific workouts as well, just like the other commenter mentioned r/GripTraining is a good place to start.",1
Thanks so much I will incorporate some of these! Do you do these on specific days or do you set aside a day for grip training? I'm on a PPL split and wondering if I should work it in on my pull or push day,1
"I don’t have a specific day for grip training, I do PPL as well and all 3 exercises I mentioned would technically be on my Pull day. With that said, you can indirectly increase your forearm strength with lifting on Push days too (heavy DB press, dips)",1
"I still hold that the best forearm workout of all time is the barbell wrist roll, all you need is a resistance band and a plate - here’s a video tutorial: https://youtu.be/HqRwcVEUxCI. This will give you a serious pump",1
Check out r/griptraining,1
Wrist rollers are great if you do them right. And I’ll third the rec for r/griptraining,1
I want to rotate bb and db shoulder press. Is this a good decision or is there not really a point?,1
What happens if I don’t get enough protein on rest days ( goal is weight/fat loss) btw,1
You'll limit the amount of lean mass you build/retain,1
You will spontaneously combust.,1
Depends on what you mean by not getting enough.  What is your body weight and protein target?  Why are you having trouble hitting your total on your rest day?,1
"If I'm doing 4 sets, 90 second break in between, 12 reps each. If I only take 90 second break, my set 3 and 4 suffers a bit towards the end, if I take a 3 minute break I don't suffer at the end at all and can even do a bit more.",1
... I shouldn't take such massive breaks right?,1
If you can afford the time to take the longer break then take the longer break. 3 minutes isn't really considered excessive.,1
3-5 minutes is a common amount of time to rest,1
"You want to suffer at the end of your reps, not your sets. Meaning just because the last set is difficult doesn't mean you are lifting properly for growth. You want your last rep(s) to be difficult that is what brings growth. Ideally you should rest for enough time between sets so that the amount of reps you can do in each set does not decrease by more than 3 or 4 at most.",1
"I took 4 weeks off lifting because of a back sprain. This is my second week back and my bench still hasn’t recovered to what it was. I used to be able to comfortably do 195x5, now I’m still barely able to do 185x5. Is this normal and how long will it take to recover?",1
My diet was ok during the break (always 120+g of protein and didnt lose any weight),1
"For future info I'd recommend not taking time off fully during a back sprain, find ways to work around it and keep moving.",1
"For where you are now I'd expect you to get back to where you are in another couple of weeks, it's all very individual but you shouldn't lose much capacity in 4 weeks off.",1
"Don't underestimate the effect of not getting your touches in.  With 4 weeks of I activity, I would expect some loss of muscle and strength.  Nothing to be overly concerned with, it will come back pretty quick.",1
"But there is a degree of detraining that happens too.  If I take a week off instead of doing a proper deload the weight feels much heavier.   Strength is a skill.  You could just need to rework your form and bracing.  Maybe it is just me but when I have those moments coming back off a break where I think, "" how do I do this again?""",1
"I would say a couple weeks so hang in there.  Also, don't just try and go as heavy as you can every time.  Back of the weight and do some quality sets really focusing of form, staying tight, leg drive, etc.",1
"Is it more effective to bulk hard and then cut for a longer period, or just barely gain any weight but only need to cut for a few weeks? Will I be missing out on anything by doing the latter?",1
"I started my first real bulk this summer, and has now gained 7-8kg, and recently started cutting. But honestly, I feel like I’ve mostly just gotten fat, and not gained much muscle. And now I’m looking at nearly 5 months of cutting to look like someone why works out. So I really don’t want to do it like this again.",1
"But will I see significantly less results by going very very slowly, barely eating over maintenance?",1
I find it's much easier to bulk slowly and cut aggressively. It's very easy to gain too much fat when bulking aggressively and get stuck in the doldrums when cutting for an extending period of time. It's typically much easier to have steady progress with a controlled bulk and then you don't need to cut for as long.,1
There's a rate of muscle growth. Any more nutrition than what's required by that rate will just become fat. Once you reach that requirement there is no additional benefits. No need to bulk with excessive calories.,1
"Best Preworkout drink for carbs/energy (no caffeine) if you like to lift first thing in the morning while fasted? I like to lift within an hour of waking up, and I really don’t like eating anything solid before lifting because I honestly just find it weighs me down. Does anyone have any recommendations for a preworkout drink that doesn’t have caffeine (I’m sensitive to caffeine), but could maybe provide me with some fast carbs and maybe protein before a lift so that I’m not totally in a fasted stat?",1
"Would apple juice, orange juice, or Gatorade be good, maybe mixed with some fruit-flavored whey?",1
"Which is better for my core, calisthenics or an ab-roller?",1
"I've been neglecting my core for a long time, then recently I started doing a five-minute calisthenics routine found on Youtube every day. Then yesterday I tried doing an ab-roller routine instead, and my abs are really feeling it. Is this evidence that ab-rolling is a stronger, more effective workout?",1
Why not do both?,1
"If you want to get a stronger core (sports, powerlifting, etc.) you need to do an ab targeted movement with enough load on it that you can only do somewhere in 5-8 rep range before reaching failure. Then you have to progressively overload that movement (increase the weight or reps) over time, like you would to strengthen any other muscle. If you want a more aesthetic core then simply go into a calorie deficit (burn more than you consume) this will remove the layer of fat that is covering your six pack.",1
"Wanted to ask whether you think my exercise routine is well structured. I go kickboxing three times a week  - Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. On the other days, I do strength training - on Tuesday I do upper body, on Thursday I do lower body, and on Saturday I do full body.  And I rest on Sunday.",1
"Impossible to know with so little information, how you split up your workouts is less important than your actual programming.",1
"Personally, if I were only weight training 3 days a week, I would concentrate on full body routines every workout. Ideally you want to hit each muscle group at least twice a week.",1
Thanks for the reply! Is 1 hour a session for a full body enough do you think?,1
"Sure, though you could probably maximize the time by looking up some lifting routines specifically for kickboxers",1
Why is creatine still expensive?,1
The short answer is: Because of supply chain issues in China.,1
"But what I really want to know is .. why? Like just why, is creatine hard to manufacture or what? Where are all my chemical engineer r/fitness users? I've been taking 3 grams instead of 5 just for this reason, because it is still expensive and it's been like that for a year or more now. It should be getting cheaper now, right?",1
"It should be getting cheaper now, right?",1
"How often, have things increased in price due to supply chain issues and then gone back down in price? Like, can you give me 5 examples you actually know of?",1
I suspect the price is here to stay to be honest.,1
Everything is more expensive now.,1
"when doing for example 4x10 series of an excercise, many times I either feel I it's a bit too light the first time, but then if i add a bit of weight, I can't finish the last series. (for example doing only 7)If i had to choose between those, what's better?this is doing hypertrophy.",1
How long are you resting? What exercise are you doing? Does your program state how close to failure you should be training?,1
What does your program say to do?,1
"It says 1 min rest, and all 3 series to be able to barely do the last reps. But it's either a bit too light at first or, I can't finish the last sentence.",1
"What's the minimum time per week I can train to maintain muscle mass and strength? And what should the other parameters of the program roughly be, eg. high volume low intensity or vice versa etc? I would like to start bjj again but don't want to lose my gains.",1
"You don't need too much training stimulus to maintain muscle mass. Twice a week full body with decent intensity is plenty, try to get at least 10-12 sets per body part per week and you'll be fine. At a push you could probably get away with once a week but there would be some risk of regression with that.",1
Looking for app recommendations that show progression toward non-weight loss goals.,1
"When I used a gym that had eGym equipment I loved the eGym app for showing progression through levels of activity (bronze/silver/gold etc.) which you'd earn through time spent working out. The best thing about this for me was that each new level showed the benefits of maintaining this activity level and it was things like 'working out this much could reduce your risk of bowel cancer by X%' or 'X extra years of healthy life' I think was one of them, etc etc.",1
"This was super motivating, but now I don't go to that gym anymore, I'm wondering if other, general fitness, apps have this type of goal?",1
"I need some feedback on my routine. I am getting back into weight training after a number of years away, with the goals of getting strong. My goal is to work up to Bench 225lbs, Squat 300lbs, Deadlift 350lbs, and do multiple sets of bodyweight pull/chins.",1
"My schedule is A-x-B-x repeat so I'm in the gym 3-4 days a week. I do some cardio on the rest days, nothing too crazy, just a hike or bike ride or some disc golf.",1
Here's what my routines look like. All are barbell unless otherwise noted. I start with a warmup.,1
A Day:,1
Squats 3x8,1
Bench 3x8,1
Bent-over rows 3x8,1
Lat pulldowns (cable) 3x8,1
B Day:,1
Deadlift 3x8,1
Chin up (machine assist) 3x8,1
Overhead Press 3x8,1
Leg Extension (machine) 3x8,1
Please let me know if I should change anything up or if I'm missing anything. Thanks!,1
You're better of following a program from the wiki.,1
"If you wnat to keep going with your own plan anyways the only major muscles you're missing are the calves. Ab isolation, leg curls, biceps and triceps isolation would be good too.",1

Beach vacation in 6 weeks. Have a nice shape to me but self conscious of belly fat. I’m 6 foot and 200 pounds. Would like to get to 180 for my vacation and I go the gym 6 days a week running a PPL. Any advice?,1
Current TDEE is about 3000. Would eating 2200 (2000 calories on my 1 day off) calories daily be too much of a cut? Protein intake is about 200g a day. I could take it week to week and try to Maintain my current lifts (obviously not looking to improve lifts over next 6 weeks) then maybe up calories by 200 a day any week I can’t maintain my current strength/lifts.,1
Any advice?,1
Try it and find out.,1
I don't think that math works out to losing 20lb in 6 weeks tho,1
no thats bascially what RP calls a mini cut it should be fine.,1
here's a pretty in-depth video by dr mike on it https://youtu.be/1FDGwP0v-rE,1
you probably won't lose 20 pounds with that deficit though the math doesn't really check out,1
I feel like I'm stuck at a intermediate level. Lifts haven't progressed a lot in a while + I haven't been super consistent. Still averaging like 4x a week over the past couple months. I watched a nippard video and he said to maybe implement PPL with one day strength focused and the other volume focused. Would this work? Been training 1.5 years.,1
Lifts haven't progressed a lot in a while + I haven't been super consistent.,1
Do you think these might be related?,1
"Earlier I was about to do my last rep on my top set for an incline plate press, as I went to do it I got this very strong achy/ pain in my head, like a migraine x 2 and it was just thumping away. It’s calmed down now a little while later but I decided not to continue my session. Has anyone else had this? I don’t get headaches after the gym and this during the set was a first to me. Having a quick look on the internet would suggest an exertion headache but this really hurt and came out of nowhere. Thanks",1
"Is doing dips, bench, and ohp to much chest exercise for 1 day?",1
Absent any context that actually quantifies things: no.,1
As my main push excersises 4 sets each 2 to 3 times a week,1
"Well since ohp isn't a chest exercise, you're doing 16 sets of chest per week. That's not too much at all",1
"What if i did 3 times a week, or 24 sets",1
"I have just graduated college and have found myself not being motivated to work out like I used to. Admittedly if being given the choice of staying home or go to the gym, I would have chosen the former. Now, I have had enough, and want to become fit for the sake of my health (especially cardiovascular health). I am a huge procrastinator and would appreciate any tips that people can give me to stay consistent. If you know any workout regimes that have really helped I would appreciate that as well.",1
"How would you set up a DUP routine in terms of the order of workouts? When training a lift with a frequency of 3x/week, I typically see some people opt for the order ""Strength, Hypertrophy, Technique/Power"" - that means you'll be doing the majority of your strength work after you've had a rest day, which makes intuitive sense, as you'd want to feel as recovered as possible for your most fatiguing session.",1
"However, the classic order ""Hypertrophy, Technique/Power, Strength"" also seems beneficial to me, as you would be able to keep fatigue levels throughout the week relatively constant. Hypertrophy work might be difficult, but it is followed by a technique/power session which is less physically demanding, and might aid performance in the strength session later in the week.",1
"The programs that I've run so far and that incorporate DUP principles tend to opt for the first order (e.g. the Brendan Tietz DUP Submax Program) - however I find there is not much to gain from the technique/power work, as I am feeling pretty beat up by the end of the week from the strength and hypertrophy sessions.",1
If you've had experience with both modes how do you think they compare? (This difference is mostly applicable to training frequencies of 5x or 6x/week as with lower frequencies you have more time to recover and the order of your workouts matters less).,1
I have to add 7.5kg to my bench press in 1.5 weeks. (92.5 -> 100kg),1
How? What should I do?,1
"Before you tell me it’s not possible, don’t even comment. I don’t need your negativity",1
How hard is 92.5 for you right now?,1
"Very hard because I pause (not as long as in a competition, but still)",1
I could probably get 95kg or even 97.5kg with bouncing the bar off my chest,1
https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/rkme3l/overtrained_50_consecutive_days_of_benching,1
Bench more,1
Run a very short deload/peak. That might work if you're fatigued and not adjusted to heavy singles.,1
"If you're already prepped to max out, you have a bigger problem.",1
"one of my shoulder is in pain when im doing a side lateral raise with a water bucket. The pain only occurs when i tried to drop the water bucket after raising it up. The pain can be describe as toothache(?), it hurts for a while and its gone. whats going on? My shoulder looks small compared to my arm, i need help",1
This is a question to your doctor not Reddit.,1
"True but i just want to know is this a typical shoulder injury or what? Because if i dont lift weight, i can move my shoulder freely around without any pain",1
"Ask your doctor. Per rule 5, we can't answer injury or pain related questions.",1
Reduce the weight to see if that helps then work back up over time.,1
Is 2250 enough calories for a 6’6 man to gain muscle and get lean or will I gain fat too  I’m about 200 lbs rn if that matters I’ve been doing 2000 a day but I stopped growing only losing fat kinda worried I’ll lose all my progress on fat loss but I also want to keep gaining muscle,1
Extremely likely that 2250kcal daily at 6'6/200lbs is a caloric deficit. Also worth managing expectations regarding simultaneously losing fat and gaining muscle.,1
"That would be a small bulk for me and I'm 5'2"" and 130 lbs.",1
I don't know where people get these numbers from...,1
It doesn't sound like enough food for someone of your size.,1
Is my metabolism adapting fast? I was losing weight at 2lbs per month and wanted to speed it up. I decreased calories by another 300 per day and I'm still losing weight at the same speed. I'm getting weaker now and look skinny. Has my metabolism adapted to my eating already?,1
"No, your metabolism doesn't change that fast.",1
"Something somewhere isn't adding up. Assuming your calorie tracking is correct, your overall activity must have dropped. Less activity, fewer calories burned.",1
"But you say you feel weaker and look skinny. What is your current weight and your goal weight. If you are looking skinny, that's usually the end point. The skinnier you get, the fewer calories burned. And if you aren't keeping up with lifting and protein intake, you could be eating into muscle, which would also make calorie burn lower.",1
There is no normal hip size.,1
Ok so...is it judgemental to consider wearing fishnet tights as leggings to the gym attention seeking? I normally don't judge but I feel like that crosses some line? Though I also wasn't complaining,1
attention seeking?,1
And if it is?,1
What then?,1
Why do you assume I'm not relaxed?,1
I didn't. I asked two questions of my own. That's it.,1
What meaning you assigned to those two questions was your own.,1
You went 0 to 100 real fast my dude.,1
You also never answered the questions.,1
"He’s had that problem for years, apparently.",1
Ayyyyy.,1
Take a deep breath and relax.,1
Why do you assume there was anything other than take a deep breath and relax?,1
You’re weird,1
Focus more on your lifts,1
I gave you good advice so you can stop worrying about feeling judgmental. Just say thank you and move on :),1
Thank you :),1
"You posted in the ""Daily Simple Questions Thread"", you very much sought out/solicited responses.",1
I hope you have a good night though!,1
I gave you good advice,1
followed by,1
sought out/solicited responses,1
responses do not have to include shitty advice. I hope the same for you,1
responses do not have to include shitty advice.,1
"which advice did you find shitty? Perhaps it's a matter of perspective I can help you understand, should you be willing to entertain a different worldview.",1
"You don’t know why they wore them, so yeah it’s judgmental to assume. If you thought they looked cool you could have complimented the person on them and maybe gotten the backstory.",1
I don't care enough to bother them during their workout or interrupt mine. Much rather let people be and comment about it on Reddit where it doesn't affect them,1
Yes.,1
I think your question here is attention seeking...,1
I don't normally judge but I feel it crosses a line.,1
"And that's perfectly fair and valid. Neither my judgement, nor your judgement, are worth getting upset or offended over, because they don't actually impact anyone anyway. I understand this and I think you do to. Judge away friend :)",1
"Edit: Also, trying being more clever next time...",1
I wanna start my fitness journey,1
"I am 17 years old, underweight (I'm 8kgs away from being in the healthy BMI range) I will have access to a gym in a few months (probably may)",1
"I wanna know how to start Do i start my creating a diet, I've tried eating for so long but i don't gain much weight, I've never trained in my life so i don't have muscles How should I prepare to go to the gym? Is it ideal to first reach healthy BMI before lifting? What can I do in these months leading up to when i can actually go to the gym? Like exercises at home or just diet?",1
https://thefitness.wiki/getting-started-with-fitness/,1
Would be a good starting point.,1
"Is whey isolate right for me?  I compete in trail running as a hobby. My exercises are hit exercises and a kickboxing class 3 times a week. I normally run a quick 5k twice a week. My weekly schedule looks like this gym, run, gym, run, gym. I don't do much lifting except for maybe 1 day of the week mostly arms since all the running has really taken care of my legs. I've managed to lose close to 45 lbs. I want to lose another 20, I do a pretty good job of staying in a calorie deficit and staying within my diet. I do have protein in my diet in the form of chicken breast or tuna. I've been thinking of whey isolate but I'm not really sure if it's right for me since I don't lift much. My goal isn't to be jacked but toned as I lose weight to help my build for running.",1
Do you only run 5k twice a week? Need more mileage to improve in running.,1
The source of protein doesn't really matter as long as you're meeting basic protein needs.,1
"The rule of thumb for muscle growth is to eat 1,6 - 2 g of protein per kg of body weight. Try to calculate if you reach this value with your diet. If you do, you don't need to supplement, if you don't, then whey protein is a great supplement.",1
I got some EAAs with my latest whey order. I'm unsure what to do with them. I reach my daily protein intake of 1.6 g/kg body weight regularly. Can the EAAs replace whey or should i intake them in addition to that? What benefit have EAAs which whey has not?,1
"EAAs are all the amino acids your body can't make. There's about 20 different amino acids that make up the protein in the human body and 9 are EAAs. Whole food protein sources already have these EAAs in them, so you don't need them separately from a supplement if you are meeting your protein intake requirement from different sources.",1
EAAs is basically very expensive protein powder that doesn't have everything in it. Very extreme dietary restrictions might like veganism might make it useful to supplement with EAAs. If you're a bit of a nerd you can look up the amino acid breakdown of your specific protein sources,1
"How far can I get only doing bodyweight pushups, squads and pull ups as a restarter? I have been stopped by injuries in the past using weights guess I have susceptible joints.",1
What is the general rule of thumb for working out after being sick?,1
"Make sure you aren't contagious, give yourself an opportunity to gauge how recovered you are and turn up. Sometimes you'll feel weaker after illness sometimes there won't be much change. You'll only know once you get into the gym and start moving some weight around.",1
"There is no rule of thumb, just do as much as your body can handle until you're fully recovered",1
"It's less about which exercise gives you more hypertrophy (we just don't actually know how to predict that very well and with the same RPE/distance to muscular failure it's probably all pretty close), and more about which can you bear the fatigue cost of, within the context of the rest of your programming. Also which one do you enjoy doing more. I'll almost always advocate doing a compound exercise over an isolation if you have the 'fatigue budget for it. Also ring push ups are cool and really teach you how to stabilize your body",1
"I'd go for the ring push ups, but I'm not a fan of flies generally.",1
"Maybe this is too simple / moronic, but what do you guys think about workout program that consists only of doing main compounds (S/D/B/O and pulls ups), for 5 sets of 10 reps at 60-70% Training max, 4 times a week, and sprinkle abit accessories such as arms & delts?",1
"Ofc also need to consider progressive overloading, but you get 20 weekly quality sets for each compound, which sounds like a simple & effective way of accumulating volume.",1
5x10 squats and deads at ~BBB weights 4 times a week sounds like absolute hell.,1
I don't doubt you'd see results if you survived,1
Sounds kind of similar to Dan John's simple strength in philosophy if not in execution.,1
"They work well, given consistency, effort, and time/patience.",1
EDIT: Programs based around main compounds (w/ bits of iso accessories) and submaximal work. Can't comment specifically on only doing 5x10 for everything.,1
Mini cut amount of Weight to lose? Does it matter?,1
"As long as it's not mass amounts of muscle I think it's fine, right?",1
Doing a mini cut from January 1st to February 1st and haven't done a cut since I first lost weight.,1
"I bulked for maybe 5 months and I'm cutting alittle bit of body fat off (mainly wanting to lower my calorie intake during the bulk because nearly 5,000 calories is just not fun to eat)",1
"Currently eating 2,800.",1
Any tips or advice?,1
Mini cut amount of Weight to lose? Does it matter?,1
No more than 2% of your bodyweight per week.,1
"For a mini-cut, which is only intended to be like 6 weeks tops, you can get away with a steeper cut than you might otherwise. Because people often go right back into a bulking phase, you re-gain anything you lost anyways.",1
"Is there a tdee calculator that is recommended as I find they vary a bit. Also what activity level would I set if I'm running the beginner routine and working on my feet 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. They mention postman etc. most of the calculators but I wouldn't be walking around all day like that.",1
"They're all estimates, so just pick one and track your results and then adjust as needed after a few weeks.",1
"I’m just getting back into the gym.  I do a PPL split, and on my pull days, my forearms/grip strength fails before my big muscle groups. By the time I’m done deadlift, row, curl, etc., my forearms are fried. Suggestions for how to deal with this? I do use straps when I deadlift to try to help.",1
"Is it normal to experience an initial decrease in strength switching from a 5x5 program to 5/3/1? For instance, based on my training max, my first go at 5/3/1 has me doing the same weight I was doing for 5x5 but with less reps. Feels counterintuitive.",1
"Doing submaximal work at the same strength will mean lifting less weight than maximal work, yes. This is intentional",1
Doing different numbers of sets/reps/weight doesn't mean you've experienced a decrease in strength.,1
Protein timing doesn't matter.,1
That’s not how protein works. It doesn’t matter.,1
"for Hevy app users: I don't know what I did but, but hevy doesn't show on my lock screen during workouts anymore. anyone know how to turn it back on? free version on ios",1
"Hey. I'm 18M, 6'1, 174lbs and 15% body fat [U.S method (86cm waist and 38cm neck)]. I'm not fat but I'm not skinny either; I have some muscle in my arms since I've trained a little of weight training (6 months) but the fat all around my body is more noticeable than the muscle.",1
I want to get fit but I don't know what kind of diet to do; is bulking and cutting the most effective option? Or is it body recomp?,1
Let me know what you think Thanks,1
"Neither is safer than the other, neither is unsafe.",1
bulking and cutting is generally the most effective way,1
"If we define 'effective' as results per unit time, then bulking and cutting is more effective.",1
It's possible up to your biological muscle limit.  It just won't be the most efficient method for achieving the result.,1
"There is no biological muscle limit. And even if that was true, it still wouldn't work. If I recomp my way from 25%bf to 10% at 170lbs, but my ""biological limit"" says that I could be 10% at 185, there's no way for me to get there without bulking. You can't build mass from nothing.",1
"Is it okay to do Squats, Bench Press, and Deadlifts three times a week?",1
"I do these in a 5x5 and afterwards alternate between Arnold Press, Lunges, and Dumbbell Rows.",1
"if you're okay with it, it's okay.",1
"ah, a friend of mine told me it wasnt good to do it consistently because I need to confuse my muscles and do something else so doing those three times a week isnt good.",1
"Your muscles don't get confused.  Variability can be a useful tool, but if what you're doing is working for you, then  ... it's working for you.",1
Just hoping someone with more experience than I can confirm that my TDEE and calorie budget seems relatively accurate and is in line with my goals. This is my first time using TDEE and tracking my calories and weight so closely so I just want to ensure I’m doing it correctly.,1
"I used a TDEE calculator and it said my TDEE was 2,066 calories per day. I’m a 25 year old female, who is 5 ft tall, 130 lbs and 35% body fat. I marked heavy exercise as I have been consistently going to 1 hour cycling class 3x per week and have been weightlifting 3x per week for 30-45 min. I have a fairly sedentary job though so I’m wondering if I should have chosen moderate exercise.",1
"Based on my TDEE I set my calorie goal at 1,500 as I’m trying to hit my goal weight of 115 lbs. I am also trying to lower my body fat percentage and gain muscle. I know that generally it’s difficult to lose weight and gain muscle at the same time however based on what I’ve read it should be feasible in my situation due to my high body fat percentage and lack of muscle currently. I’ve also been tracking my macros and aim to have 45% carbs, 30% protein and 25% fat to support my goal of losing weight while also gaining muscle.",1
Basically just looking to get confirmation that this all looks good and is a good plan for myself. If there is anything you see that doesn’t add up or anything you think I could improve please let me know. Thank you!!!,1
That's a good starting point but it's all made up numbers right now.  Going forward you'll need to track your intake and weight change and adjust things to the real world data.,1
Great! Thank you! I’ve been at this weight for about a year and a half but prior to that I lost 65 lbs over 2 years but it was a very uncalculated and chaotic experience so trying to be a bit more calculated and focused about it this time!! Appreciate your feedback!!,1
"Wow, good job!",1
The only thing that sticks out to me is basing your macros on a percent of your intake.  For now the numbers shake out fairly well but may cause problems in the future.,1
Better to base protein and fat on your body stats (or goal body stats) and then back fill in with carbs.,1
Thank you!,1
Can you explain to me what you mean by this? How do I base my protein and fat on my body stats?,1
"yeah, sorry I meant to give you this link: https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/#Macronutrients",1
"Basically you multiply your bodyweight by a coefficient to get your macro intake.  Like I said, you're landing in the right spot now with your %s, but things could go sideways if/when the your intake changes.",1
Awesome thank you for explaining that!!,1
"After years of trying to find a healthy relationship with food and being to afraid to see how many calories I have been eating I am now hopefully on a more healthy path. Over the past few weeks I have been calculating between 900-1100 calories a day but according to my health app I am burning about 2800 calories a day. I thought this would help with weightloss but I am reading that I should be eating about 2000 calories a day, how do I do this?",1
every day,1
"If you are doing cardio at the gym maybe a slight decrease, but given that you are bulking it's best for you to keep your calories clean and high because your body is always undergoing recovery/synthesis even on ""off"" days.",1
Would this be okay to do as a replacement for leg extension machine? Could I do this with both legs at the same time and a dumbbell between my feet for extra resistance? Or is there a better alternative for leg extensions without a machine? TYIA!!,1
"Machine would be best, but doing both the band and dumbbell would be good, with the db there’s going to be the most resistance on the quads when your legs are stretched in front of you, and with a band when your knees are bent like the top image. Hope you understand",1
"That makes sense! Thank you for your response!! I’m switching to a gym with no machines, so I’ll try out both variations.",1

Does version 2 of the routine here have a meaningful advantage over version 1? I've been doing version 1 (sometimes doing an additional 4th set on the exercises and taking it to failure) so far and have been entertaining the thought of whether or not to switch to version 2.,1
Or am I better off to keep doing what I'm doing right now until I can no longer make progress and then switch to an intermediate routine?,1
Stock response:,1
"Every program needs to balance exercise selection, volume, load, intensity, accumulation, progression, and so on in order to present stimulus while simultaneously managing fatigue.",1
"This makes it sound WAY, WAY more complicated than it actually is, but it is something that can be, and is, fucked up.",1
Beginners have a common set of characteristics that have an effect on how one plans for these variables. One of them is that beginners reliably grow muscle and progress in strength at a prodigious rate from a laughably low amount of volume. Another is that they can only really handle a laughably low amount of volume.,1
"And truly, the only thing more reliable than beginner progression is beginners burning themselves the fuck out. They do so in a variety of incredibly predictable ways (often combining several), which include:",1
Setting too much exercises/volume on day 1 (usually by picking a bad program or creating one themselves),1
Setting too high a relative intensity on day 1 by selecting too high a starting load,1
Progressing in load/volume too quickly,1
"Worrying about what might eventually fuck up their progress or what lagging body part might be left behind, and so trying to add in something to combat every potential issue, thus ending up with endless amounts of fruitless work",1
"The recommended routines are all recommended because they have proven themselves to have a good tuning to all of the variables mentioned. Often, they also have guardrails set up to keep beginners from fucking up a good thing (looking specifically at 5/3/1 here).",1
Your workout routine is very good. It does not require tinkering with. You do not need to do more work until the program tells you you need to do more work. It'll tell you that by no longer working.,1
"The number one thing that most people eventually run into is the inability to add more volume because of insufficient work capacity. If you're REALLY chomping at the bit to add more work, you should do more conditioning. It's magic.",1
"if you're REALLY chomping at the bit to add more work, you should do more conditioning. It's magic.",1
"Yup,I've spoken to and read a few articles by MythicalStrength. this article of his is actually why I sometimes do a 4th set on the exercises and take them to failure. so I learn to get a feel of where my limits really are. I presume this is alright,and doesn't harm the routine like adding unnecessary exercises like many beginners do.",1
"I lift 3 days a week and do my low-impact cardio (I don't jog/run or use the stationary bike because I simply don't enjoy doing those things,I hope this is alright. Although at my current weight,high impact workouts are out of the question for the moment) followed by flexibility/mobility work. These are done on my off days from lifting.",1
I eventually plan to replace this kind of cardio workout with the Martial arts training that my gym offers as well. Boxing pads or the heavy bag at a fast pace I presume is a great way to develop both aerobic and anaerobic conditioning. (and via an activity I actually enjoy unlike running),1
"So far,I'm already seeing the benefits (or maybe its just placebo? who cares,lol). My last squatting session was hard,but I wasn't getting out of breath doing it. I remember reaching failure (could be because of my conditioning failing at the time rather than true muscular failure,I'm not entirely sure to be honest..) squatting 140 lbs in the past. Now I squatted 188lbs (plates come in KG) and will be attempting to squat 199/200lbs the next time I do this exercise. My deadlift already hit 200lbs! I hope I still have more linear beginner gains to come!",1
Does version 2 of the routine here have a meaningful advantage over version 1?,1
"No, not significantly.  Just carry on, learn the lifts and put some weight on the bar.  There are some great programs in the wiki when you are ready.",1
