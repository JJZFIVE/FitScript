"Since Sherpas climb Mt Everest regularly while carrying the equipment, why is being a climber still celebrated?",0
I don’t mean to diminish the effort and risks required to summit Mt Everest.,0
"But I’m trying to understand that if the mountain is often climbed by the Sherpas who, as far as I understand, also carry the heavy equipment, it seems to me that they are the ones who are doing most of the work and they are doing it regularly, doesn’t it make the climbers glorified tourists?",0

Why do female athletes wear such revealing uniforms?,0
Not to be that guy but I really don't see why some sports like track and field or beach volleyball require uniforms with almost their whole ass out. Would it really change the sport if the shorts were just a little bit lower? Why is it like that?,0
Edit i fucking hate reddit why did i even ask,0
How do you argue against “A key that opens many locks is a good key…”,0
"I was having a chat with my friends and the topic of promiscuity came up. One of the guys gave this common analogy, “A key that opens many locks is a good key, but a lock that is opened by many keys is a bad lock.” I ofcourse think it is quite sexist and objectifies women, but how do you argue against it?",0
"EDIT: To elaborate, he didn’t just stick to this analogy but the reply I got was also this, “female mammals own serial selection and males compete. It would be 1000x easier for a girl to convince a squad of dudes to hit it than it would be for a guy to convince a group of girls.” Again, these are not my views, but I want to know how to counter these opinions.",0

Should I be upset that my job treats me this differently from everyone else?,0
"I've been here about a year and a half. I work at a small business. 10 or so people in the office, my supervisor and I out in the warehouse. Nobody is rude to me, I've gotten raises like everyone else. I'm not the newest person.",0

What do I say when someone shows me a video of them dancing and it's just really bad?,0
"My mom recently started attending sexy dance classes and whenever she shows me videos to ask for my opinion (I am a dancer myself), I just can't bring myself to lie and say it's good, because it is just really embarrassing. I do appreciate her effort and challenging herself at her age, but I feel like she is quite delusional when it comes to her ""skills"" and I am always honest and try to express my opinion in a respectful and constructive way. But she always gets offended, no matter what I say, as if she wanted me to say that her moves are super sexy and she's just amazing, which is far from the truth. If anyone saw these videos, she would be a viral meme, that's how ridiculous it is. I dread her asking me these types of questions, because it's just too hard to lie that it's goos, but then she doesn't speak to me for days.",0
"Am I wrong for being honest? I try to tell her how to change her moves as well so that it looks better, but she just gets even more mad. Am I wrong to be annoyed with her lack of objective self - criticism? And again, it's not like she is just a beginner dancer, she just tries too hard to be sexy but can't move for shit and it just looks awful. It is not a distant friends either, I wouldn't be this honest to someone who I barely know, because I just wouldn't care for them to improve that much.",0

Does everyone in America have debt?,0
"In England, its fairly common for people to be in some kind of debt but it's much less oppressive and substantial, it seems, than American debt. Student loans are a lot more forgiving over here and the interest rates aren't as ridiculous, and my mum who works a low paying job is completely debt free and we own an apartment outright (this is a fairly rare occurrence though). From what I can tell, the biggest source of debt is the healthcare system- my friend is a type 1 diabetic, and he gets all of his insulin paid for of course, and one vial in America is hundred of dollars if I'm correct, so that's at least $1000 every month? Sorry if I'm incorrect, but that is honestly ridiculous and I don't understand how anyone could viably live in the US without HUGE debt unless they've got well covered jobs with insurance, and even then insurance companies aim to shred any claim to pieces. If I was living in America it would be way cheaper to save and sell property to move to Europe, your currency exchange rate and cost of living would decrease dramatically if you migrated from California, for example.",0

Occasionally, I will wake up mid-dream, feel sleepy, and then think to myself, “hmmmm I’m going to go back to sleep, let’s continue that dream.” I then immediately go back into slumber and will consciously decide my next course of action in the dream. Eventually I forget that I’m in a dream and it becomes just another fantasy, but it’s so weird that I can just pop back into a dream and pick up where I left off.
