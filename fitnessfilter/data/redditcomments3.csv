Is there a rule of thumb about when you should start wearing a belt?,1
"I don't know. I've grown to just ditch belts and any kind of support all together. I forgot my belt one day on squat day and it felt like I was gonna crumble like paper under the weight. If I can't lift weight without external assistance, then i can't lift it. If my moms trapped under a car, I'm not gonna go looking for my belt. But thats just my philosophy. Obviously it all just depends on your goals.",1
Never wear one,1
Not really. Personally I put my belt on once I get around 70-80% of my max. You can search up the belt bible by Stronger by Science for some great info.,1
anyone know a reason why your chest press can be weak? My pr for bench is about 170 while my squat and deadlift are 350 and about 390. My bicep curl is also about 50 on each hand. I train chest twice a week.,1
"Not many details here but what is your volume looking like? Are you continually attempting to reach near-failure? Many people misjudge where failure is. Even though you train twice a week, it may only be 2x2 each day or something low. When you could either raise the reps or the sets. Its also possible you just subconciously don't like chest so you don't tend to push yourself enough (i.e. continually progressively overloading).",1
,1
"Simple answer: Volume- lift more- lift heavier. And if you want to increase strength, people generally recommended 3-5 reps.",1
Check your technique / form and bench more.,1
"A general question I struggle with is, how do I workout without effecting my next days energy?",1
"I have been working out for about a year and mixed it up with cardio and resistance training. Being physically and mentally in shape are both equally important to me. When I start working out moderately (not even heavily), I find that the next day I am recovery mode and I cannot focus well at my job or at any mentally draining task. How do I improve my physical health while not effecting my mental focus?",1
More sleep? More food? Less stress? Less volume? Less intensity?,1
To me this sounds like you aren't sleeping properly. I've never had mental fog the day after a workout.,1
Am i fucking my gains up if i do a split of,1
"chest, shoulders, triceps, biceps.",1
"legs, back.is it a big improvement if i move my biceps to 2 or not a big deal?",1
Not a big deal.,1
"last year, I lost a bunch of weight. I went from nearing 200 to average weight. However, I didn't gain any muscle, barely had any to begin with, and probably lost some along the way.",1
"my question is simple, but would undoubtedly get removed as its own thread: I don't want to go to the gym. What's a good plan to build muscle fast from home? What I'm doing now (using what I could find on Reddit and Google) is consuming around 150 grams of protein a day (I would say I weigh between 140 and 150 lbs) and working out during work (from home). I could probably work out with higher intensity, but let's say I do maybe 50 situps, 50 pushups, 50 squats, plank for 5-10 minutes overall. I also try to get some cardio in, but a) it's very snowy here so I can't go for runs outside or skateboard b) cardio is great for losing weight, but I'm under the impression you can't lose weight unless you eat a calorie deficit, under which conditions you can't build muscle, so I figure by Summer I'll hopefully be ready-ish to cut.",1
"Working out is still hard on me and it's difficult to hold, say, a plank for very long (around a minute with relative ease). Am I doing anything wrong? Could I be adding any exercises? Am I working out the right amount? Am I eating the right amount? My focus is on my upper body and core (I want abs), but I'm told not to skip leg day either",1
"""build muscle fast"" doesn't exist. It's a slow process. You need resistance training. Said resistance can come from your bodyweight, rubber bands, regular weight etc. You also need progressive overload. That means a decent plan/routine with progression (in resistance, total volume etc ) over time. We dont know what equipment you have and what your current workout really looks like so its hard to give advice.",1
"As for a) hike, get a stationary bike, walk stairs or just accept you will have more cardio when weather permits.",1
"As for b) its not... Eating less is great for loosing weight. Cardio helps a bit, depending on how long/hard you go. However it IS great for staying healthy and promoting recovery. But since we have no clue what your cardio looks like, we cant say much. Also: why would you want to loose more weight?whats your height, sexe, build? If you are already at ""average weight"", focus on resistance training while eating a small surplus.",1
As for your last paragraph: you're not giving anyt relevant information to base advice on.,1

"I've got Severe DOMs even tho I've been tranining to failure for almost a year and never experienced anything like this, but for whatever reason for these past few days whatever muscle I train, I get severe DOMs afterwards, I trained my abs and did a pull day 3 days ago and my back is still aching, same with abs, I can feel pain in my rear delts even when rested while writing this even though I didn't even do any rear delt exercises. What could causing this?",1
What program are you doing? I'd take a deload week. If your program doesn't have one I'd look up how the deloads in 531 go and just do that.,1
When was the last time you took a deload or rest week?,1
"Bad diet, sleep, increased stress levels, overtraining, there are many causes why this could happen.",1
"This year I started counting calories with 3000kcal per day and weighing myself every morning after having peed. My weigh for first 10 days was around 83.5-83.9kgs. Yesterday It suddenly went down to 82.6, i thought, well, maybe that's a one day anomaly. Measured today and it's 82.4. I don't know what happened. Been taking creatine all this time. Doing heavy squats 3x per week. Drinking water. I'm training only legs because of my arms injury.",1
"It's a pretty negligible change in the grand scheme of things. Keep weighing yourself and track a weekly moving average (this is important, not just the average) to see what the trend is.",1
"Bodies are weird, some days you'll retain a ton of water, some days you'll shit an entire lb",1
"Weighing yourself daily is really useful for seeing trends but to get a real idea of your loss or gains you need base it on weekly or longer averages. Give it a week or two, if its consistently trending down either dial back your cardio, make sure your counting is correct or add another 100-200 calories",1
"Why does it seem like every workout plan focuses on quads for leg days? Shouldn’t there be equal exercises for quads, calves and hamstrings? Likewise, upper body workouts always seem to have multiple things for pecs and shoulders, and only a bit for biceps, triceps and back.",1
None of the programs I have done have had unbalanced leg volume. I would check out the wiki and pick one of the well designed programs from there.,1
"Just so you know squats don't only work quads, they also work basically ever muscle under your chest, so its not really a quad exercise. The Pecs and shoulders and back are the largest muscle groups in your upper body, the smaller muscle groups like biceps and triceps will still get stimulus when doing back, shoulder and pec exercises but not the other way around.",1
Which workout plans are you looking at?,1
Why does it seem like every workout plan focuses on quads for leg days?,1
Do you have an example?,1
"Yes, a plan should be balanced.",1
"My leg day consists of machine hack squats, rdls, leg extension and leg curl. Is this enough to build my legs?",1
You should follow one of the programmes from the wiki.,1
"It's mainly not about the exercise selection, it's rather about the amount of volume (# of working sets in a week) to determine if it is enough to build muscle. Keywords: MEV and MRV.",1
"If you don't want to bother to much with this, it's always good to use a proven routine and not build your own.",1
calves?,1
"Yes, might want to throw in some calf raises if you care for them",1
Is there a % of 1 rep max to use when starting the fitness basic beginner routine?,1
It's a beginner routine for the first three month of lifting. Beginner usually don't have a 1RM. You just pick a weight that is hard for the given rep range.,1
"Beginner at that stage will probably be able to increase the weight linearly each week or each training session, so using the % of a RM won't be accurate for this kind of routine, since the RM will change rapidly at that level.",1
"I want to start lifting to gain more muscle. I’ve looked into it for months and practiced form for different excercises several months (at home and at my boyfriends). My bf is an athlete who has been lifting under professional supervision since he’s been 12 or 13. So you could say that i made a lot of research and also have someone around me who can help me. One thing my bf can’t help me with is the question when i should increase the amount of times i go to the gym, since youth athletes in germany (at least footballers) only lift twice a week. My aim is to go 5 times per week and i thought about starting with 3 since i have football training twice a week, then upping to 4 before i reach my final destination of 5 days per week. So my question is when do i know that i’m ready to go to the gym more frequently?",1
Going to the gym more frequently just gives more options for splitting up your weekly exercise volume. There are other factors which are more important for how much progress you will make. If you have football training twice a week (and I guess matches) then fatigue management will also need to be a consideration.,1
So my question is when do i know that i’m ready to go to the gym more frequently?,1

"125 kgs and 20% bodyfat? Is he 2 meters? Otherwise, doubt.",1
It's possible but I wouldn't want to do it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,1

"possible, but not healthy at all, he'l lose tons of muscle mass",1
"Is it normal to look stringy after decreasing calories on a cut? I was cutting losing .5lbs per week and wanted to speed up the fat loss. I decreased calories by 300/day and began losing weight a little faster, but I noticed my muscles were looking way worse. I look skinny, feel hungry, and low energy, and I don't even have increased vascularity or definition. I even had a high carb day and nothing changed.",1
Am I better off increasing calories again and just moving more? I think decreasing cals over increasing activity was a mistake and now I lost muscle.,1
"I lost 1/8"" off my arms each week and I have no increased muscle definition or vascularity at all. I even had a refeed day and nothing changed.",1
Theres lots of reasons why you'll lose size and vascularity or muscle 'fullness' when substancially cutting - as well as increased hunger/energy levels.,1
"Obviously your losing mass, but also water/glycogen, etc, your metabloism will slow, youll produce less test, etc.",1
"Personally when trying for anything over a 300 cal deficit i prefer 2 high carb refeed days at maintenace per week, just dont find the one day does it for me.",1
Sadly if you just want to blast a continuous substancial cut theres going to be negatives.,1
Maybe you're just less muscular than you thought you were?,1
"Okay guys, I’ve a beach holiday in 7 weeks and have made some decent strength progress over the past year. However still have enough body fat that I’m uncomfortable with my shirt off. What do I do? Cut calories, increase cardio and maintain my 6 day a week PPL programme?",1
Buy some swim shirts and save yourself from skin cancer.,1
Figure out TDEE.,1
Figure out a target weight.,1
Divide it by 7 weeks.,1
Figure out a diet deficit based on how much you need to lose per week.,1
Implement it.,1
"That said, 7 weeks isn't really that long. You don't mention how much you want to cut but the sums above should flag just how likely it is you will hit your target.",1
"That said, and this may be hard to hear, but most people on the beach won't give a fuck about you, you're just not that important. Even if they do care about your body they will more then likely completely forget about you in 3 minutes after leaving the beach.",1
cut fat till muscle reveals and then bulk,1
"Yeah, basically",1
I'm cutting for the first time. I'm a horny motherfucker but now I got a very low libido because of the cut. Is this normal?,1
Are you eating enough fat?,1
It can be,1
"Hey everyone! Gotten back into the lifting game after a good few months being out of the rythm. Spending some time the first few weeks to test my limits again, and I think I can definitely deadlift more than I currently am. My issue is that I feel limited by the weight my hands are able to hold back. The rest of my body can deal with more weight, but if I can hold it up with my hands, I'll be kinda stuck where I currently am until my hands catch up. Anyone got any tips?",1
Anyone got any tips?,1
Straps.,1
"Don't let your grip hold back your deadlift. Get some straps, use some chalk, change your grip",1
Have you tried mixed grip?,1
"Do what you like, but I wouldn't personally do it often. Usually lots and lots of fat from the cheese and meat. I wouldn't enjoy a pizza that had enough veggies on it for me to really consider it to have a serving of 3 of veggies. And I personally avoid processed carbs (ie the dough) except as a treat because they're high calorie for nothing much and often lead to me feeling bloated.",1
"While yes, the calories would be good for a bulk, my own personal eating habits when it comes to pizza would have me eating entirely wayyyy too much of it with not enough nutrition. I'd likely overeat that day, even on a bulk.",1

"Looking for some input on exercise vs. sleep. I've gotten used to working out 6 days a week (lift and then short run), but now I have a pretty demanding job so some days I don't get home until close to midnight. On those days, I feel pretty terrible about not working out since I'm so used to working out almost every day. My question is, would it be better fitness-wise to get an extra hour of sleep or get a workout in but end up with less than 6 hours of sleep?",1
"Better for what? Can't build muscle and strength without training, but sleep is obviously important for functioning at work, home, etc. Missing a day here and there is no big deal, but you can accomplish a lot on a good 3 or 4 day program if 6 is too much",1
Get the sleep. I've lived a life where for various reasons I couldn't sleep for more than about 5-6 hours a night. It fucking wrecks you.,1

"Can anyone give some tips on how to avoid psyching yourself out on the bench press? Specifically when your hitting PRs. Just started really working the bench press about a month and a half ago. I'm hitting new PRs every week til I get to bodyweight on the bench. Right now I'm only benching 140 x 8 reps for 3 sets. Up from 125 3 weeks ago. Same thing, 125 x 8 for 3 sets. Then just to total failure on set 4 (usually ends at 2-5 reps on last set).",1
"Idk, it's just 140 is an intimidating number. Like, I've never in my life benched 140, even for 1 rep. Should I attempt a heavy 1RM, just so I know what I CAN do? I really think it's just the ""never done this much weight before"" that gets to me.",1
"I wouldn't go for a 1RM. Ease into the heavier weights with sets of 5, and then on the following week, sets of 3 (basically, a powerlifting wave) before resetting back to sets of 8-12. That's what I do with most of my training - 3 week waves",1
"Rep PR's always made me more confident that I could hit higher numbers than pushing a single rep max. If I can do 225 for 10, I can do 240 for a couple. I liked nsuns for this. If I hit my top set for 12 reps, I can add some weight and hit all my reps the next week no problem",1
"Miscalculate the plates and put 140, or have your friend do it.",1
"Tbh only half joking, and I wouldn't wanna be off by too much. maybe ""misload"" all the work up/warm up sets too so there isn't a big jump.",1
"I have PR'd, either in weight, reps or just RIR many times thanks to misloading. How ethical is it to do it on purpose? Especially for a weight that you know you should/would be able to do",1
"But really you just gotta do it, a friend/stranger to hold you accountable could help too even without lying",1

"Hey all. I began my cut about 5 weeks ago on Dec 6th and I’ve barely seen the number on my weighing machine change since then, despite being on what I consider to be a fairly steep calorie deficit (down from 3500 to 2000).",1
"At first I attributed it to water weight gain from creatine, which I started consuming on the first day of my cut (didn’t do a loading phase, simply 5g a day). But by now my body should be saturated with creatine and should have stopped gaining water weight right? My weight has literally been the same since the 26th of December with a fluctuation of 100-200g here and there. I don’t feel like my body is recomping either (which I expected to happen since I’m a fairly new lifter with less than a year of training experience) since I haven’t really seen any significant strength gains at the gym and my waist circumference has remained pretty much the same.",1
Where am I going wrong? Should I decrease my calorie deficit further?,1
Why do you believe you are on a fairly steep deficit when the evidence you have collected over the past 5 week clearly states you aren't in a deficit?,1

Is a trap bar dead lift safer than the conventional,1
"Statistically speaking, in the same sense that it's safer to walk across a suburban street than a highway, yes. Either could hurt you, you could do either for many years and never get hurt. But trap bar DLs ARE easier to learn and more natural to do properly. It's fair to say they're safer.",1
All deadlifts are safe,1
Both can be done safely but trap bar is arguably easier to learn.,1

My left shoulder is always giving out and I don’t have any 35 or 45 weights btw.,1
Why am I not progressing for this long?,1
You are only doing 7 sets a week and on what I assume is basically a double progression scheme. You need more volume for sure and some form of periodization. 531 is the popular choice around here. FSL is very beginner friendly.,1
"Are you on a program? Are you eating in a surplus? Do you have an actual progression plan? I also think you have your sets/reps backwards, unless you’re actually doing 40 sets of 8. I don’t really understand your thought process behind those rep counts. Where did you get those from? 10 warm up sets?? I’m confused.",1
Has anyone got over anxiety/panic attacks over time using exercise? What have you done to ease the chest pain etc.? What was your plan and journey like?,1
Hi I've been running through a beginner weightlifting routine for about a 8 months now and wanted feedback on planning my bulk/cutting cycles going forward.,1
"Backstory if it matters but in May '22 I (5'10"" male) had a bodyweight of 170 lbs, 13.7% body fat, and 140 lb of muscle mass (according to my renpho scale). I wasn't counting calories but did a good job of listening to my body going up to 175 lb bodyweight by September with 14.3% body fat and 143 lb muscle mass. From there until January I was dirty bulking and hit 182 lb bodyweight, 15% body fat, and 147 lb muscle mass.",1
"Now currently I'm just clean bulking but I've realized I don't have a long term plan in place and would like to make sure what I have is reasonable. Should I be aiming to bulk for X weeks, then cut for X weeks. Or is it more effective to aim for some target weight, body fat target, or some other physical metric. Also when I do transition from cutting to bulking or vice versa, do I want to have a buffer period where I step up or down my caloric intake or do I just rip the Band-Aid off.",1
The scale isn't accurate for body fat so don't go by that. The saying of bulk until you think you're too fat and cut until you think you're too weak is a good one to go by,1
Can someone suggest me a good back routine focusing upper back more?,1

For the past couple of months I've been following the same weekly routine of back-chest-legs-shoulders and have been seeing steady progress. However I've been reading about the benefits of the push-pull-legs routine and am intrigued by its efficiencies. Should I make the switch now or wait until I hit a wall progression-wise?,1
you don´t need to do ppl. I´m on the same split as you and I´m making steady progress.,1

Sedentary. Then adjust as you get tracking data.,1
"Choose whatever activity level you think you are, then drop it down one. I definitely wouldn’t put sedentary though. You can always adjust later on.",1
I’d put it in whatever the middle of the range is. You’ll end up adjusting your intake after 2-4 weeks anyway based on how your weight changes so it really doesn’t need to be precise.,1
"If you increased the size of your foremans with exercises like reverse curls, wrist extensions, and wrist curls would that increase your grip strength potential?",1

"Week A: Bench 3x5 , Barbell row 3x5, Squat 3x5, Front Squat 3x10, Farmer Walks, Lat pulldowns 3x12.",1
"Week B: Chinups 3x5, OHP 3x5, Deadlift 3x5, RDL 3x10, Farmer Walks, Face pulls 3x12",1
Or,1
Should I switch my Front Squats from week A to week B and switch my RDL from week B to week A?,1
Edit: sorry I mean Workout A and B not Week A and B.,1
"I’d personally switch them from what you have listed here, but it ultimately doesn’t make a huge difference.",1
"It’s workout “A” and “B” not week a and week b, you know that right? You should be alternating back and forth between the workouts each time you lift",1
"I'm 62, 5'10, BMI of 33.3.  Was in great shape until about 15 years ago.",1
It time to lose weight and get back into the active lifestyle I once enjoyed.,1
"1st.  Got my docs ok, with no restrictions.  Just said to start slow, so I'm walking a mile a day for the first month.",1
Here's a quick could questions:,1
"My pulse at the end of my walk is 114 bpm.  I sit, and record recovery time after two minutes.  After two minutes my pulse is 88.  My normal resting pulse is high 50s low 60s.",1
Is my recovery time ok seeing though I'm just starting out?,1
How should I be recording recovery time?,1
"What are you hoping to measure by measuring recovery time? Your recovery rate is normal, but even if you recovered somewhat less well, it wouldn’t be a horrible thing.",1
You're 17. Just eat more and do any of the routines.,1
https://www.jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101085062-2016-help-a-friend-get-stronger,1
"Read the wiki, pick a routine from the wiki, they’re all good. Do not worry about finding the best one, as it doesn’t exist. There’s a section on weight loss and muscle gain that will tell you everything you need to know to figure diet out.",1
I agree you should read the wiki. But I also just want to throw in that the basics are not complicated. Work hard lifting weights. You don't need optional exercises or the perfect programming to see results. You don't need tons of supplements or some magic diet tricks. You don't need to weigh and count everything you eat.,1
"Don't let all the noise confuse you on the basics. Hard work, progression, and consistency are the bedrock.",1
"Pick a beginner program. Eat plenty of nutritious food, including protein rich food like meat, dairy, and eggs. You learn more as you go.",1
Read the wiki. Don’t skim it. Read the wiki.,1
Simple question : What motivates you guys to keep working out everyday? I find myself constantly stopping the workout progress and only workout once per month. Max,1
I have long term goals I want to hit and to get there I need to be pretty damn consistent,1
I'd say it's the feeling you get after a workout and filling out the spreadsheets that keeps me going.,1
0 motivation. It's part of the lifestyle/routine. Like flossing and brushing  teeth before bed.,1
"I enjoy exercising. My training plan is set up so that I get to do stuff I like, rather than exercises I hate. If you don't enjoy going to the gym, then perhaps running is for you, or swimming, or biking.",1
I enjoy the progress when my training results improve.,1
I enjoy not having to count calories.,1
I have a couple of pre-existing conditions which will get worse if I don't exercise.,1
I enjoy training and like getting bigger and stronger. The process is generally fun and when it isn’t the results are worth it.,1
"I can’t socially afford to be short, overweight, a minority, and average in personality",1
"It’s not motivation, it’s discipline. I know the benefits are there and so I put in the work.",1
"Being big and strong is awesome, and I like being awesome more than I hate working out.",1
"You don't have to exercise everyday, just pick the days that are most convenient for you and try to stick with them. As for the motivation part, I actually find that I'm not as motivated as I used to be, but because I've made it a habit, I get a strong itch to exercise around my usual time. I still enjoy my workouts, it's just that I don't need as much motivation or willpower to go the gym",1
"The Terror of Aging Like Crap. I don't want to be 70 and limp/shuffle instead of walking, or be 60 die from breaking a hip, or have a heart attack at 50. I DO want to live a long, fulfilling life with high quality of life. This is my ""why?"" ... therefore, I have a workout habit. And I try to eat more veg than meat, take my vitamins, etc. etc.",1
"I look in the mirror and think to myself, I could improve that. That’s pretty much it",1
"Honestly speaking, I want to gain strength as it's very important and would help so much in daily and long term life, but I also really want an aesthetic body.",1
"I've had to restart my gym journey probably 6 times in 2 years, the longest I've gone consistently was 1 month. But I remind myself every time that long term, the benefits will be so amazing and I'll thank myself for it forever.",1
why do you brush your teeth or take a shower or go to work or get out of bed,1
"a trully stupid question: how many times a week should I workout if hypertrophy is the focus? I've seen people going to the gym every day for an year and I've seen people going crazy over no rest days so I'm not sure what to think anymore. I'm currently going everyday because I do not feel overly sore nor have squedule restraints, but is the ""lack of rest"" (that I do not feel like is needed) hindering my progress? I'm young if it matters (20yo)",1
"Rest is very important as its giving your body time to build the muscle (which it does during rest). The workouts are to 'break' the muscle fibers in order to trigger the body to repair them which is making them stronger/larger. Now there are rest days (no gym) and then there are low-impact ""rest"" days. On the low impact days, some people do yoga, walking, swimming, etc. active but not weight-lifting. Sleep and rest are just as vital as gym-time.",1
"Lack of rest becomes and issue when it limits your ability to do the work. I workout every day, just plan accordingly.",1
I take a rest day or deload week when I need one. Listen to your body.,1
"But also, follow a proven routine.",1
Follow a program that has a certain number of days in the gym per week. Most programs are 3-6 days per week.,1
I'm getting to the point that I'm squatting 1.75x and deadlifting 2x my bodyweight (225 & 320ish),1
When is wearing a belt starting to be appropriate? I feel like I'm getting into big boy weights and want to reduce my risk of a hernia,1
I wear one after I get to 75-80% of my max but you can wear one whenever you want.,1
"Belts don't reduce hernia risk, but they're awesome and I'd wear one starting on day 1 if I had to do it all over again.",1
Yeah that’s about when I got a belt.,1
Read this: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/amp/,1
"I think belts are great, you can start wearing one whenever (or don't). They help you brace your core more effectively. They don't prevent hernias.",1
belts don't decrease injury risk but they do help you lift more!  I got a belt like 6 months into lifting cause I love gear.,1
Theres a good chance it is the sugar alcohols. I know they bother some peoples stomachs.,1
"Need some advice. I've never set foot in a gym in my life and I just signed up for a membership. My goal is to build up some mass so I can fully participate in moshpits without feeling like a beach ball this summer. For context, I'm 5'6 and 105-110 pounds, built like a stick. What kind of exercises should I do?",1
The other two guys are spot on.,1
"Find a full body program, there’s several in the wiki, and eat more.",1
"go to the wiki at the top, read all of it, do the recommend routine, eat more",1
I am having trouble developing volume in my chest. I am lowkey pretty ripped everywhere else but I just cant get my chest bigger.

I workout at a busy planet fitness so getting a barbell bench is tough somedays and always agitates my shoulder. But any Advice would be greatly appreciated. Thnx.,1
,1
Edit*,1
If anyone has a program rec lmk. THNX,1
"Your unnecessary amount of chest volume isn’t going to do what you think it is. Like someone else said, you need to get on an actual program and eat more.",1
You need to eat more. No man at under 150 lbs has a big chest.,1
a barbell would really help overload! also doing a program with different rep ranges.  you could modify SBS hypertrophy for a bunch of different dumbbell presses for a possibly more effective bro split type setup?  this felt bad to say but just an idea.,1
hey i’m trying to get into the gym and all and i want to start by progressing at home with dumbbells and no bench. i’ve been mostly doing ppl splits and i just want to know if there are any good routines that don’t require a bench?,1
"Why no bench?  It’s fairly important to any of the dumbbell routines. When I started Working out, I used a dinner table bench with a yoga mat on top if cost is the issue.",1
"there's a dumbbell split in the wiki, just sub any bench pressing for floor press, absolutely fine.",1
Need fitness advice. I've been doing strength training for the majority of my workouts. I have some stubborn belly fat and that last few pounds to shed off. I've been thinking about doing one week of just cardio and steps (10000/day) to see if that will help sort of confuse my problem areas away 🤣. And then get back into weights after that week. Thoughts? Will it help?,1
"Because I work from home a lot, walking to the gym, working out, and walking back are my main bits of exercise each day. I love doing it and feeling like I’ve been productive.",1
"My main question is if I am spending most of my day fairly idle working from home, how important is it really to take a rest day? I’m currently trying to lose weight rather than gain if that’s important.",1
"If you find you are not recovering from your workouts, a day of rest can be helpful.",1
"Depends on your volume, frequency, intensity, and ability to recover. I'm old, and I like weight training 4 days a week and having the rest for cardio/recovery. One of the leading lights of this sub has trained every day for something like 4 years.",1
"Run challenging programs, pay attention to how your body reacts, chart progress, and make decisions based on available data. Everyone is different.",1
"If you can go more often feel free - I find that on cuts I just don't recover enough from day to day to go back to back like that for very long, and find myself needing a three or more day break eventually. You can also opt to just take another walk on your off days to go somewhere else - maybe a grocery store or something? - to get more steps in without overexerting your strength training.",1
"Yes. Depending how you train but I wouldn’t recommend anyone to train every single day. 3-5 is plenty for most. In a calorie deficit you are probably best off training fewer times per week since recovery will be limited, no matter how much you rest.",1
Is there any harm in going to the gym at say 8pm then going to bed after then taking protein for breakfast?,1
Edit: there is no harm at my level of fitness. Thanks for the replies folks,1
As long as you’re getting enough protein each day you’ll be good,1
No,1
"No, unless you're advanced, then things like meal timing and macros timing come into play",1
Is there an upper body equivalent to Agile 8 or Limber 11? Looking for something I can do before every Bench press and OHP workout to get primed.,1
"This is what I do based on what I need the most help with. The order I do them in, how long I do each one, and whether I even do them all depends on how I'm feeling that day. Not sure of the names of some of these:",1
"Foam roll/lacrosse ball massage for back, neck, etc",1
Thoracic extension over foam roller,1
Band pull aparts,1
Band dislocates,1
"Wrist warmups (wrist circles, etc)",1
Cat cow and shoulder circles (in quadriped position),1
Thoracic rotation in quadriped position,1
"Sit in deep squat, thoracic rotation up to the sky one side at a time",1
Might do some very light tricep extensions if my triceps still need some warm up,1
"If I’m just lifting for general health, how many sets per week should I aim for? I was thinking of doing 3 of squat, bench, deadlift, rows, OHP, and pull-ups.",1
"Don't know what your prior history training is but I'd highly recommend Wendler's 5/3/1 or Stronglifts 5x5. They're ""refined"" cookie cutter programs but if your goal is to stay generally healthy and fit, they'll be more than enough, most especially the former.",1
The best program is the one you stick to. Best of luck!,1
"Whatever your program dictates. Regardless of goals, you should be on a program; just find one that align to those goals.",1
"Im struggeling to improve my ab (sit-up) load, doing relatively low weight with 12 repsx3. I stick to my programm but dont improe this area. would it be fine to try to go back to high weight + 3x8 reps, instead of the 2x12 1x12+? With high weight it feels a lot better when reaching the final reps, it's quite a crazy burn which I miss with high reps, low weight.",1
"The weight isn't really that important, ab shape and midsection is firstly shaped by your genetics, second is bodyfat. I did competitions with maybe 2-3 sets of leg raises a week. Diet and genetics play a huge role there",1
"I'm looking suggestions for a lifting program that focuses on volume instead of heavy lifts. I'm on a medication for the next half year that's making me feel 10% weaker and it doesn't make sense to me to be doing 5/3/1 or something with intense sets that requires you to expend a lot of energy within a single set. I've had to decrease all my lifts that were based off percentages of my 1RM. Ideally 4-5 days a week, or a 6 day where I can cut down the days.",1
"I'm not sure I fully understand. If it makes you 10% weaker, why not just cut all your training numbers by 10% and build up from there? Then when you are off the medicine, you will get 10% stronger.",1
SBS hypertrophy has more volume at lower percentage of your max than like 5/3/1 but sets are if anything harder because you're closer to failure on each one,1
I’m from Europe and tomorrow I’m going on vacation in Asia with my parents. Will stay there for 3 weeks. I’m scared of losing my gains so I plan on working out while I’m there. I’ll also bring my creatine because I’ve been consistent with it and I don’t want to lose the benefits by stopping now. Is this normal or do I need to chill out and just enjoy my vacation? Does anyone here also train while on vacation?,1
"Yes, you need to chill out. When you return from your vacation, it'll probably take 1-2 weeks for muscle memory to bring you back to where you were.",1
"Speaking from experience - if you have a lot of downtime, it wouldn't hurt to find a gym. But if you are near beaches or have a lot of stuff planned, just forget about exercise and enjoy yourself. The only time i've lifted on vacation was on a cruise where we had 3 days until the next dock, and I had a ton of down time.",1
"Do whatever you feel like, don’t overthink it mate. Take time to enjoy your vacation but staying in some sort of routine is always helpful.",1
"In the long term, a three week break won't impact you. When you get back, you'll most likely have lost a little bit of strength/mass, but you'll get it back in around the same timeframe as long as you are able to fall back into your usual routine.",1
Whether or not you take creatine for those 3 weeks doesn't matter.,1
"If you didn't train at all for three weeks, it would take you maybe 1-3 weeks of training when you get back to recover any lost progress. Train if you want to but don't worry about it too much. The gym will be there when you get back and at least for me a trip half way around the world doesn't come up very often.",1
You won't lose any significant gains in 3 weeks. And it won't matter in the long run if you take your creatine in those weeks either. Chill out.,1
"Fat consumption is important for hormone regulation. You can get too little. You don't have to worry about too much, dietary fat doesn't make you fat. Excess calories do, regardless of what macronutrient they come from.",1
"Fats are essential for life sustaining functions and hormone production.  One would want to ensure they are eating the fats that support these things, irrespective of training goals, if they wish to remain alive and healthy.",1
"Beyond that, fats are nice for gaining since they are over twice as caloircally dense as carbs or protein, but that's about it.",1
Fat is not the enemy. Have at it.,1
Do you need rest days from... walking?,1
"I walk my dog every day plus my work requires me to be on my feet running around for hours. For example, yesterday I got almost 17,000 steps.",1
"My feet feel tired today, like I don't wanna get up. Yet, I had planned on taking my dog on a hike today since I'm off work. I'm also overweight (BMI 26.5) so there's probably a bit more pressure on my feet than they were designed for lol.",1
Should I be thinking about rest days from walking or is that nonsense?,1
Sounds like you might have just done more than you've gotten used to. You can either take the day off or just take it easy on your walk through the woods. Personally I'd take the walk. Love getting outside and it looks like most of the USA is about to get hit with some nasty weather rest of the week. Get it done when you can.,1
Do you get 17k steps on average? Why do your feet hurt more today than usual?,1
"First bulk ever completed just before christmas, and now I'm on a cut.",1
Question: what is the minimum amount of protein I need to maintain? I really want to focus on a cut and not worry about protein too much.,1
"I heard it's 0.8g per kg, is that true? That's about 65g for me (I weigh 81kg), and I currently eat double that. Could save some calories if that's the case. I will also be going back to working out 5 days a week to promote muscle use of course. Got 2 workouts in this week, doms holding me back for now.",1
"This is a very good guide on protein intake.  Read the section called ""Optimal daily protein intake for fat loss.""  It talks about people who are in pretty good shape and want to lose some body fat while retaining muscle. It suggests 1.6 - 2.4 g/kg of protein.  So, for you about 130 g to 195 g of protein.",1
I think the number you read was 0.8g per pound and misremembered.,1
0.8g/kg is probably lower than you want; I believe this is the standard recommendation for everyday people who aren’t worried about muscle mass. The standard recommendation for lifters is 1.6-2.2g/kg for optimal results. Certainly you want at least 1.2g/kg,1
I only know freedom units but you want to aim for around 1g of protein per body of lean body mass on a cut. Some people do 1g of total body weight just to be safe. Protein is more important on a cut than it is on a bulk.,1
"I am a large person, close to 280lbs, and have lived a very lazy lifestyle. I have added a couple exercises in an attempt to help lower my weight. I am doing 4x25 jumping jacks, pushups, crunches, 4x30 second planks and have an under-desk cycle that I pedal until the calorie counter hits at least 300. I am attempting to do these all daily. I know it isn’t a lot but would this have any meaningful impact on my weight in the long run? I’m not trying to get “strong” or ripped right now. Just healthier.",1
"270 lb person chiming in. I won't reiterate what the other commenters have said about diet, but they're right.",1
"As far as exercise is concerned, the best exercise is the one you enjoy doing. If you look at your under-desk cycle, and think ""ugh"" you're going to treat it like a punishment. I hate running. Hate hate hate it. If my fitness plan involves running, I will make any excuse under the sun to avoid it. However, I love lifting. I will do it any chance I get. On my rest days, I gaze longingly at the gym when I pass by. I have gone out in sub-zero temperatures to go lifting. That love is what helps me stick to it.",1
"Weight loss comes down to diet, not exercise. While exercise is great, you need to realize that those calorie counters aren't accurate in the slightest. Eat at a deficit.",1
What you're doing now will definitely help you lose weight! I recommend tracking your calorie intake and making sure you are in a calorie deficit. The exercise and any other physical activity you can add in will make it easier to stay in a deficit.,1
"Getting active will certainly help you get fitter and lose some weight since you'll be doing more than you have been previously. But it has to be done in conjunction with a change in your diet lifestyle as well. You can start slow, but you should find ways to consume a few hundred fewer calories per day. Either smaller portions, cutting on liquid calories, switching to a lower calorie option of certain foods etc.",1
what would be your top 3 exercises to recommend to someone who’s trying to prioritize their core strength? (not obliques) if,1
"roll outs, hanging leg raises, and heavy (heavy) carries.",1
Hard to prioritize core strength while ignoring obliques,1
It would be like focusing on back strength and ignoring your lats,1
"total newbie question:What would be a good starting point for gym clothes, for a man who's planning on mostly using cardio machines and some basic strength training, about 3 times a week.  Just generic workout clothes.",1
I basically don't have any gym clothes. The closest I have is hiking clothes.,1
"what items, and how many should I buy.",1
Cheap t shirts and athletic shorts from the clearence rack at a Walmart or equivalent.  All you need is clothing that doesn't restrict movement. Anything past that is asthetics or personal preference.,1
"shorts, tshirts, socks, shoes.  as many as you need given the frequency of your laundry doing, though you can probably get by with one pair of shoes.",1
shorts and a t-shirt or tank top,1
"I’m going to take a different approach to the clothing part than most here would, with the caveat that this isn’t a necessity AT ALL. I find that when I look good and like how I look/what I’m wearing in the gym I feel better. When I feel better I have a better workout.",1
"So find some decent quality shirts, sweats/joggers, tanks, tee shirts, and a sweatshirt or two from a brand you like that fits your budget.",1
Nike/adidas/new balance/under armour/columbia outlets are a good place to start on a minimal budget.,1
For mid range stuff start at the same brands but at their main line stores or their websites. Dick’s sporting goods also has a great selection of the above brands. Walk in and see what speaks to you.,1
"If your budget allows for more premium stuff take a look at lululemon, vuori, alo, and ASRV.",1

How hard should be my strength training during a cut?,1
Should i keep doing it to failure like in the buffing stage or should i do something different?,1
"As hard as you can manage to recover from, the approach doesn't change even if you're weaker on a cut. Follow a program",1
Idk if this applies but what are some great brands of workout apparel for women? Leggings sports bras etc?,1
Edit: trying to find some nice things for my girlfriends birthday as she is trying to get more Serious about lifting.,1
My wife swears by Lululemon. I really like Nike stuff but can't speak on their women's lines.,1
"Honestly, just got try things on.",1
"I LOVE my Nike sports bras, but i'm not a fan of their current ones (texture wise... mine are over a decade old at this point :X). I had some Daniskin knee-length leggings that I LOVED and they've nearly fallen apart (also had nearly a decade). But I had some cheaper store-brand ones that just pilled up and felt awful.",1
"If you stick with the brand names, while more expensive, they're often nice. But I have to try everything on cus sometimes the shape of them isn't quite right for me.",1
At the risk of overthinking...,1
"When I brace for squats and overhead presses, I tend to puff up the sternum/chest at the same time I brace. If I puff up the chest firs and inhale later, it limits how much air I can inhale for bracing.",1
Is there a correct order for this or does everybody do their own thing?,1

"Having some doubts about whether I've chosen the right routine for my goals - I started running 531 BBB a few months ago, and I like running it. But my only goal is gaining size, isn't 531 BBB still kind of powerlifting focused? Would something like THIS be more suited to my goals?",1
531 is great for building size. That's why it's called boring but big.,1
"But my only goal is gaining size, isn't 531 BBB still kind of powerlifting focused?",1
"That it still has low-rep sets has nothing do with powerlifting. You will gain size if you run it. Just don't run the template on his website, since that's an old version.",1
"Two people have nearly identical muscle mass of 105lbs. One person was training for 10 years, one person for 5 months. Why can the person that has been doing it for 10 years can do heavier sets, even though their muscle mass is identical?",1
Strength is a skill and one person has over 20x the experience.,1
"One person was training for 10 years, one person for 5 months. Why can the person that has been doing it for 10 years can do heavier sets, even though their muscle mass is identical?",1
He has had 9 years and 7 months more practice.,1
"The person doing it for 10 years has more skill, has better technique, can recruit more muscle fibers, is probably better conditioned, etc.",1
TL;DR:,1
"What does everyone here think about whole body heavy lifting sessions 3-4x per week? How does it compare with doing a splits-based workout (e.g. chest + triceps 1x per week, back + biceps 1x per week, etc)? My goal is to have a more muscular but defined athletic build.",1
Details:,1
"I've been doing a traditional splits-based workout at the gym, which consists of a dedicated day each week for chest + triceps, back + biceps, shoulders, legs, etc.",1
"But I'm thinking of switching things up and am wondering if it's possible to do a whole body heavy lifting session 3-4x per week, with hypertrophy and an athletic, defined build in mind.",1
Can the body heal quickly enough to make this possible if my workout is structured properly? This would entail spreading out my splits routine over the course of each week rather than devoting a single day to any particular muscle group.,1
"Day 1 might include bench press, lat pull, forward dumbbell raise, squats, etc.",1
"Day 2 might include dips, rows, shoulder press, triceps extension, deadlifts, etc.",1
"The idea is to hit each muscle group more frequently without overtaxing them in any one session. I want to continue lifting heavy, but am hoping that limiting myself to only one heavy exercise for each muscle group per session will allow them to bounce back very quickly.",1
Thanks!,1
How you organize your weekly volume is pretty low on the totem pole of success.,1
Is 6 days a week too much?,1
"I'm 46M. I've had a 10 tear hiatus from the gym and became severely out of shape. I've been working out since October and have seen and felt a lot of improvement. However, I'm getting frustrated with my gut and fat%. I'm thinking of increasing to 6 days a week and alternating upper body with lower and cardio until I can at least get my waist where I want it.",1
Are the rest days in between important enough to take them instead?,1
No amount of lifting or frequency of lifting is going to make your gut and fat % go away faster.,1
"Clean and fine tune your diet,and then be patient. It will go away eventually.",1
Only you know what is too much for you.,1
"But your problem stems from your diet, not how you choose to exercise.",1
https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/,1
"47M here, I’ve been working out 7 days/week for the past year. I lift in the mornings 4 days/week and do cardio on the other 3. And then do BJJ in the evenings 4-5 days/week. I ramped up to it slowly, but now it feels completely sustainable and I’ve made good progress.",1
The others are correct that losing weight is all about eating less than you burn. The challenge I found was that as I added activity I wanted to eat more and the net result was no change. BJJ in the evenings solved that problem - there’s nothing worse than rolling on a full stomach and afterwards I was wiped and just wanted to get ready for bed so I didn’t make up the calories afterwards. That allowed me to drop that last stubborn 25lbs.,1
How do you good folks handle cravings nearing the end of a cut?,1
"During my cut I’ve dropped from 18.5% bf to 12.7%.  I feel I’m right there at the finish line,  but the cravings are getting intense.  I’m struggling to not eat an entire pizza at the moment and I’ve been screwing up my diet the last few days.  Any tips?",1
fill those cravings with large servings of vegetables,1
Lots of diet soda,1
Be stronger than the cravings.,1
I've been working out on and off for the past 7 years. I was able to lose a good amount of weight but have never been able to add significant muscle mass. I've mostly been doing strength training (lower reps/ heavy weight compound movements).,1
,1
I've dealt with shoulder and groin/hip pain since the start of my fitness journey and have been able to push through and commit to going to the gym and staying active. I've recently taken about a month's break due to travel and am having trouble getting back into it.,1

"Why is that when I switch from bulking to cutting, I hit more PRS? Is it because my body is spending less energy on digesting food ?",1
"Do you mean right when you switch, or do you mean you keep hitting PRs throughout your cut? I generally do not hit PRs during a cut, and towards the end I see noticeable decreases in strength and I feel lower in energy.",1
"How often do you weigh yourself to track progress when trying to gain muscle? I read that a good rate of weight gain during a bulk is around 2-4 lbs per month, but I feel like my weight fluctuates a lot, making it hard to accurately track. Gained a lot of muscle and weight very quickly during my first 3 months of lifting, but since October it's been much slower, although I'm still eating and lifting the same or more. Sometimes the scale shows that I've gained a bit of weight, but other days I'm back where I started. Is this just beginner gains naturally slowing down, or does it sound like I should eat more?",1
general advice is to weigh yourself daily and then take the averages for each week and ensure that is what is trending upward over time,1
daily fluctuations are normal and to be expected,1
Everyday but use the trendline to base decisions on.,1
"If you're not trending in the right direction or at the right rate, alter your intake to facilitate that change.",1
Where can i post a form video of me deadlifting for some advice,1
Right here in this thread as an answer to the pinned top comment,1
"is 16/8 fasting safe to do everyday over the long term? seems like it, but is there anything I should watch out for?",1
I prefer 8/16 personally,1

It's completely safe as long as you are able to get your nutrition in.,1
It won't really do all that much special for you either. But if its a way for you to keep calories down have at it.,1
"Dealing with some extreme DOMS on my very inner thighs where it meets the pubic region. This happens everytime I use the reverse hip abductor machine (the one where you put your feet outside and push the weight inwards). Felt fine for 12 hours, sore 24 hours later, and extremely tight/sore 36 hours later. It reminds me of the first time I started weightlifting two years ago when I couldn’t extend my arm for 4 days after bicep curls.",1
"Is this normal? I always get some DOMS after a good chest or leg day workout but it’s always manageable. Perhaps this means I’ve been forgetting to do inner thigh work and this is why it hurts so bad? I didn’t know I was neglecting the area, I thought all parts of the thighs are worked by squat and lunge movements that I do very often.",1
FYI reverse hip abductor is commonly called hip adductor.,1
"how often do you use this machine? DOMs are usually from novel movements you haven't adapted to. I squat all the time and do lunges rarely; even though they work the same muscles, doms from the lunges will be much worse",1
"Hey everyone! I used to be fit when I was a teenager, and I went to the gym a couple times in college. After graduation/during the pandemic I lost a lot of strength and generally felt weak. I'm sick of feeling weak, and started going to the gym 3-4 times per week for the new year. Honestly, I'm loving it!",1
"My beginner goal is to be able to bench press 135 comfortably. I'm 5'11 165lbs and started with just pressing the bar to get comfortable and work on my form. On my 5th session I was able to do 4 reps 95 lbs, then 3 reps on my next set, then 2... I guess my question is, what's going to be a reliable process for working up to 135lbs? I'd be really happy if I could do 3 sets of 5 reps of 135lbs",1
"Just do GZCLP. Simple linear progression where you add 5 pounds every week, or more if your amrap was crazy.",1
https://www.saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/,1
Just do the standard progression protocol until you start failing regularly.,1
"The reliable process is to follow a proven program like the ones offered in the wiki, or from another professional source.  They will provide you with rep schemes, but more importantly intensity, volume, and what to do with plateaus and deloads.  All important stuff--simply ""adding 5 pounds"" linearly will only get you so far.",1
"And hopefully we're talking about many lifts for many body parts, not just a bench press... ;)",1
Is it normal to have a kind of bloated look all day?,1
"I am bulking at the moment so naturally have accumulated fat. In the morning my stomach doesn't look too bad but then from when I start eating until going to bed my stomach looks kinda fat, but could this just be bloating? I'm still going to bulk but just want to know if I'm bulking too hard.",1

But I just paid $150 to be bullshitted BY AN MD about how me using the damn machines at the gym and not having pizza and donuts every day apparently makes me some kind of bodybuilder.",1
"Complete BS. The only accurate way to measure your bodyfat % is to die, have someone dissect your corpse, and weigh the fat tissue",1
"DEXA scans are calculated from a 2D pixel density image.  As such, they have a hard time calculating fat when there's a denser substance (such as bone) behind it.  So depending on how that 2D image renders can lead to fairly different numbers between readings.",1

"I'm going to start stronglifts 5x5 as a 5' 10"" 165lb 18M with 22% body fat. I am kind of weak and plan on following the segestion of starting with just the bar. I was was wondering if it is bad etiquette to use the squat rack if I am just squating the bar if my gym only has two of them? I feel like im in the way and preventing other people from doing their ""real"" workout, if that make sense. Should I do kettlebell squats or something instead until I add more weight?",1
"Also, how should I be eating? I'm already a bit chunky, should I eat just a little more than maintenance?",1
"other people from doing their ""real"" workout, if that make sense",1
"You matter. Your workout is real, too.",1
should I eat just a little more than maintenance?,1
"I would. Focus on getting more protein, probably, but I'd generally make one change at a time. The first 2-4 weeks of going to the gym are hard. Don't try to change too much or you'll hate the whole experience.",1
You have every right to use the rack.,1
I was a bit pudgy when I started and gained strength and lifting skill just fine while in a caloric deficit.,1
A person's right to use the equipment doesn't depend on how much they can lift. In my experience the vast majority of strong people in the gym understand that weaker people have the same right to use the equipment as anyone else.,1
"Your workout is a real workout!! You’ll be lifting more than the bar in no time, so this is literally only a day 1 problem.",1
"PS. The programs in the wiki are better than stronglifts IMO. But start where you’re comfortable, they’ll be there for you later if you want.",1
"I struggle to do 2-3 muscle groups at once in the gym, for example after back I struggle to train biceps, after chest I struggle with shoulders. I am a beginner and was wondering if I could do one muscle group earlier in the day and the other later. Any advice helps, thx.",1
"what program are you doing?  if the answer is one you made up, consider doing the beginner routine in the wiki.  it takes like 20 minutes.",1
Still on the 5/3/1 scheme and everything goes well. I have the luxury of a gym at work which I use occasionally. I have dedicated gym days with my gym buddy so those days in the office are kind of optional and not part of the program that I’m following. What are good ways to use these optional gym days that could benefit me without hurting the actual program days ? I’m kind of worried that doing heavy compounds will hamper my 5/3/1 days.,1
Shall I just focus on more isolation for example ?,1
What conditioning are you doing? For BBB it's recommended to do 2 days of hard conditioning and 3-5 days of lighter work.,1
"Cardio+conditioning on off days like the other guy said. Any cardio and any HIIT type of stuff. Kettlebell swings, muscle snatches, burpees, timed exercises. Endless variety and you feel a lot better during your training days too",1

For the past few months I have been surviving off pb&js for lunch but that and the rest of it doesnt reach my daily protien goal. So what healthy foods (that require either minimum cooking or none) could I eat for me to at least reach 60+ grams of protien for lunch?,1
"200g of chicken breast is about 60g of protein. Add some vegetables(or whatever else you prefer), and you have a solid meal.",1
You guys know when you're cutting and you're in a calorie deficit? Your body gets use to the amount of calories you're eating at a certain point and then you have to increase the deficit more etc.,1
"So once you reach your goal, how do you get back to your normal calorie intake where you started without picking up fat that you just lost?",1
Your body doesn't get 'used to' the amount you're eating when you're on a deficit. Your body requires less energy intake when your body mass decreases.,1
You don't go back to your intake where you started.  You increase to your new maintenance intake.,1
"Just add back in some calories once you start maintenance.  For example, if you were losing a pound a week (500 kcal deficit per day), then add 500 calories to whatever you were eating during your cut.  You'll gain a bit of scale weight because of increased water retention from carbs, increased food volume in stomach, etc, but it's not actual fat.",1
"Then continue to weigh yourself regularly.  If your body weight is stable then that's your new maintenance calories.  If you are still losing weight from week to week, add more calories in.  If you are gaining, reduce calories.  Repeat until your average bodyweight is stable from week to week.",1
"So once you reach your goal, how do you get back to your normal calorie intake where you started without picking up fat that you just lost?",1
"well when you lose weight you require less calories, so your ""normal"" calorie amount has now changed. So you eat based around that. You just follow the exact same principles you used when losing weight, but in a surplus rather than a deficit.",1
"I do cardio for around 30 to 45 minutes 6 days a week, I have picked up an injury today what seems to be shin splints what is likely from my run, should I continue to work my upper body has today and tomorrow are workouts what don't focus on my legs? Or should I rest for a couple of days?",1
"I don't see why shin splits would stop you from even doing a leg day workout. I've never had shin splits, but as I understand it, it's usually walking/running that's painful, right?",1
"Yup, I've always been able to squat, deadlift, whatever just fine. Even with some pretty bad shin splints at times.",1
Is arching your back during bench the commonly accepted form?,1
"My PT told me to arch using my legs today, which I did, and it helped with the weight a lot, but I also distinctively remember my college coaches threatening to make me run laps if he saw daylight under my back.",1
Outdated training? Or is it a Football/Powerlifting thing not to arch.,1
"Outdated. Retracting/depressing your scapula and using leg drive to maintain full body tightness is going to cause some amount of back arch. Whether you want to arch beyond that to decrease range of motion and change leverages is up to you, but there is a minimum amount of arch that everyone should be setting up with.",1
I was thinking that the very slow recovery after the gym might not be post-covid but rather overtraining. Could overtraining symptoms last for like 2 months like whatever it is currently ailing has for me?,1
You are almost surely not overtraining unless you are on the extreme of training ie marathon runner or something.,1
"You may be under-recovering. Meaning take a look at your sleep, diet, stress, etc and see what needs improvement.",1
"Did you have COVID 2 months ago? That's probably more likely to be affecting your performance than ""overtraining"" lasting for two months.",1
"Yeah! But you'd be thinking it shouldn't be affecting my recovery times so harshly. I actually went to a doctor about this and he says everything is fair dinkum in terms of blood values, heart and lungs. But even then my recovery is absolutely fucked all out of a sudden and i just cannot solve this mystery at all.",1
"Why would you think it wouldn't be affecting your recovery? I think COVID is a very valid reason for it. I'm not saying it is the reason, but you seem to be under the impression that it isn't related at all.",1
You mentioned stress in another comment. That could also be a factor. You could also just take a week off lifting and see how you feel.,1
what body fat percentage does this look like objectively,1
17.436842%,1
thanks 🤩,1
Probably about 18%-ish??,1
"the gym is just a place like any other. if someone clearly wants to be left alone, leave them alone. if you are making eye contact and smiling, go talk to them if you want",1
Can i hit all parts of chest in the same day if i do one set to faliure on each exercise,1
"Well, there's only two parts and if you're working your chest you're working both of them.",1
"I know the phrase you can’t out train a bad diet, but how true is this? Obviously you could look better if you’re eating your body weight in grams of protein vs someone who eats half of that everyday, but is this really a huge factor? If you’re hitting your maintenance or cutting / bulking goal would it really make a big difference? I want to start eating better to increase the quality of my workouts but I don’t know if there is that big of a difference. Thanks",1
If it didn't make a big difference we wouldn't harp on about it so much.  It's also much bigger than your workouts.,1
The phrase has more to do with amount of food rather than the quality. Sometimes people think they can just go do 3 hours of cardio a day and eat 6000 (or some large amount) calories and still lose weight. But the reality is that no amount of exercise can really be done in a day that can out pace the diet of a person who is just eating carelessly.,1
"That phrase is more in regards to people needing to get their diet in check if they want to lose weight, since it doesn't matter how hard you're training if you're eating 2000 calories over your maintenance. As far as protein, yes it's important. .8g/lb is the generally recommended minimum, so if you're serious about training then I'd aim for at least that.",1
My creatine bottle says I should take only 3 grams of creatine a day which are 3 pills but the internet says 4-5 grams is good so can I then take one more?,1
You can take more if you want.,1

hi! I’m F21 bmi 18. I want to build muscle and get stronger. All the guides I’ve found for women online have been about losing weight but I’m trying to put it on. Does anyone know any good workout plan/food plans they can send me? I’ll eat like 1000 cals a day in fast food and I’m always getting sick and want to get better.,1
There's nothing specific to women btw. Read the wiki and chose a workout plan from there.,1

I'm supposed to take this prescribed medication for 30 days that's been giving me diarrhea. I was also trying to bulk as a skinny-fat individual. I've lost 2 pounds over the past few days since I started taking this medication,1
Should I continue weightlifting heavy and trying to bulk even though I have diarrhea after every meal?,1
"In the grand scheme of things this 30 days doesn’t really matter. If it were me, I’d 100% continue to lift to the extent the diarrhea let’s me, and do my best to eat how I was attempting to (be that cutting or bulking.)",1
"Even if you don’t gain any weight or strength for these 30 days, it’s still worth attempting to, even in subpar conditions in my opinion.",1
"even if he loses weight its still good progress because he's skinny fat, he'll probably build muscle and lose fat at the same time",1

"Not meant as a putdown, but why? Why not follow something made by someone with much more experience?",1
Your reps seem quite high imo. Generally a range of reps is good to stimulate your muscles and muscle growth in different ways.,1
"I’d suggest something more like 5x5 for your first exercise each day. Adjust the range to 4x8-10, 4x10-12 (or 3x8/10/12) to add more variety.",1
"I’m also a bit confused how each day is structured - it doesn’t seem like you’re targeting a specific muscle group each day. I think you’d benefit a lot from following a pre-made workout plan, like the ones on this sub.",1
There are reasons why everyone is going to point you to the wiki and to pick a proven program. Here are some of them.,1
What is the weight progression scheme? This is just a list of exercises and reps. What do you do if you can't hit 3x12?,1
"You're going to have zero energy to complete this routine. You have bench, squat, and deadlift for reps on the same day, twice a week. If you're actually pushing yourself, you are going to be brutally tired and miserable trying to hit that third compound of the day.",1
"How long do you expect this to take? I'm assuming the weights are low because you are new to working out, but there are warm up sets and rest times needed.",1
"You are neglecting your back with lack of horizontal rowing. 3 sets of wide grip rows a week, while you're doing that much chest volume is NOT a good idea.",1
You have no direct hamstring work.,1
"The order of exercise doesn't really make sense. Why would you put reverse fly first? You generally want to put the taxing T1 compound, the exercise you want the MOST out of, first.",1
so ive very suddenly gained 2 to 3 lbs after i wanted to start losing weight,1
i had a long layoff off creatine and i started with 5g a day again like 3 days ago and ive been eating a carnivore ish diet for like 2 days.,1
am i gaining in fat or muscle or is it water weight?,1
my weight is important because i need to get below 70 kg so i can box at my desired weight class asap and im 77 kg as i sit here typing.,1
"You do not gain three pounds of muscle or fat in the space of a couple of days. That is why you should track weight over months, not days, and pay attention to trends instead of individual weigh-ins.",1
Probably water weight gain from creatine,1
Don't stop taking creatine like someone else said the weight will stabilise it doesn't go up indefinitely. You're just holding onto more water. Creatine is awesome,1
How much muscle do you need to build before you’re allowed to wear white vests?,1
refer to this chart:,1
"as you can see White is in the middle of the chart, requiring just 5 Muscle in order to wear it",1
Can we get this in the wiki please?  Tired of seeing all the vest disinformation out there and the daily questions.,1
"Ive heard that Big Vest pays off the mods to keep this info out of the wiki, but I'll never stop fighting the good fight!",1
"Over 9,000.",1
There is no muscle prerequisite to wear white vests.,1
Egg on your face when you show up in yours with only 4 muscle,1

"Hi Reddit, I've been going to the gym for about 2 months now, and feeling great about my PPL split, but was just wondering if I could get some advice on improving my leg day (which I've just derived from a basic leg day video on YT). I'm 1.77m tall (5'8) and weigh just under 70kgs (155 pounds). I currently train legs twice a week and have been seeing pretty good gains. How can I optimise my routine further?",1

When do you deadlift?,1
"Don't worry so much about optimizing, optimal doesn't exist, if you're getting results then just stick with it",1
Do you deadlift on your pull day?,1
I see nothing wrong with this except I would switch out either leg press or Bulgarian split squats for stiff leg or romainian deadlifts.,1
what is the limit to how high someone can get their metabolism?,1
https://www.aaas.org/news/human-endurance-has-metabolic-limit,1
"Recently finished my first cut to 15.2%bf and was planning to start my first real bulk starting next week, but i'm doing research on bulking and so many sources say to stop bulking at 15%, and start a bulk in the 8-12% range. I am a still a novice and my lifts aren't that high (5RM - B:180, S:175, D: 235, OHP:115).",1
Since my lifts are still low should I ignore the advice to not start bulking until i'm at 12%? I've already been cutting for 5 months and i'm feeling weaker in the gym.,1
Is a slow lean bulk my best option right now?,1
"IMO bodyfat percentage is not a good indicator to try to use. The biggest issue is you don't actually know what your bodyfat percentage is. There is no easy, accurate, and cheap way to measure bodyfat percentage. Any number that a scale or other bioimpedance device splits out is uselessly inaccurate.",1
"Look in the mirror. Are you okay gaining more fat? No matter how you bulk you will gain fat. You can lose it later during a cut. If you want to get leaner first before bulking and gaining fat, then do that. If you want to start gaining more muscle now then start bulking.",1
"Body fat is immensely difficult to measure accurately so using a specific number as a gauge of whether or not to bulk is pointless. If you’re tired of cutting and want to bulk, then bulk.",1
sub 10%! That sounds like figure competition numbers. My cut almost never gets me below 12% and I am usually around 16% - 17% after my bulk. Are you planning on competing?,1

I have some questions around rapid weight fluctuations - I think it's probably water retention  (or the inverse) but would like some opinions.,1
"I'm M28, 5'6"", somewhat-intermediate lifter, 12% bf, was 135 lbs or so in Oct/Nov. Between then and now, I got into a holiday mood, almost no working out, being lazy with what I eat and losing what seemed to be 5 pounds of weight. I was also on creatine and that stopped during that period.",1
"When I got back to my regular schedule around 1.5 weeks ago, I was alarmed, decided to ramp up my workout frequency, and do consistent calorie surpluses. I have not been tracking them very properly, but I think I end up landing at +300 cals or so daily.",1
"Over the last 1.5 weeks, I seem to have gained 2 lbs or so of weight. There's no way I ate +7000 calories. Is this just my body accumulating water?",1
"Edit: I did some looking up and that 100% seems to be the explanation. Does the water retention reduce over time? I am bad at eating enough to bulk, and need to monitor my weight regularly to make sure I'm on the right track.",1
water/glycogen,1
I was also on creatine and that stopped during that period.,1
That could account for the loss. Did you start taking creatine again?,1
My weight goes up and down by 2 lbs all the time. I regularly weight 2 lbs different one day to the next. These fluctuations don't matter.,1
Considering ATP replenishment rates and relation to rule-of-thumb of 3 minute rest between sets.,1
Are replenishment rates muscle specific?,1
"Clarifying the question with additional context, could a completely separate muscle group be worked within that three minutes without adversely impacting replenishment?",1
That three minutes of dead time kills me. Suppose you've got a treadmill or exercise bike available. Can you spend that time putting heartrate in Zone 2 and still replenish ATP? Opportunity to fit in more aerobic without later sessions would be efficient.,1
One reason to rest is to catch your breath. You aren't catching your breath if you are riding a bike,1
Useful trick for zone 2 running is that is about the pace you can maintain comfort while breathing through your nose only. Can use that to pace yourself when out for a run without any heartrate monitoring.,1
"That feels comfortable, sustainable for long periods, without need to catch your breath.",1
Revealing my recognition I don't fully understand the details for the 3 minute break between sets.,1
"If I am already catching my breath from a hard set, hopping on a bike is going to make it take longer for me to catch my breath and be ready to start the next set. Maybe it would work for you though.",1
"Replenishment rates for ATP isn't something you ever need to think about or be aware of, and I wouldn't use that type of knowledge in programming over the vast experience coaches and athletes have accumulated. It may help explain why things work, but it's a small part of a large picture",1

I'm using my resources to help her get kick started.  My issue is I know as a male what kind of protein stack I need to lose fat and gain muscle.,1
"My wife is 133lbs and has always had a ""thin"" look to her naturally.  She usually can eat like garbage and it doesn't really show up all that much.  Her goal is to get that ""bubble butt"" look that most women are after.  My goal is to not supplement stack her with things that will bulk her too much.",1
"As on now I'm taking the ""ON Gold Standard 100% Whey"" which I've taken through my last few rebuilds with great luck.  I drink a shake first thing in the morning to get roughly 50% of my protein and then a shake before bed (recovery) to get my remaining 50%.  All the while eating clean during the day.",1
"I've never trained a member of the opposite sex, so I was wondering you ladies out there.  Do you have a protein that you like most?  Will my supplements work?  How often do you take your preferred protein supplement?",1
"Again I should mention at 133lbs she will just simply need to grow muscle, she doesn't have much to lose, save, 5-10ish lbs around the stomach.",1
Thanks for any advice!,1
protein is gender neutral my dude,1
"Lady here! Whey is whey, same as for dudes.",1
Do you have a protein that you like most that fits the female body type?,1
What does that mean?,1
The advice for men is the same for women.   https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/,1
"""protein stack"" wtf",1
"Protein powder is never absolutely necessary, nor are any designed for ""female bodies."" We can eat all the same things you do, but my first place to start would be tackling diet rather than adding unnecessary products. She can get plenty of protein from food without needing any supplementation whatsoever.",1
"I agree with that.  I was thinking eggs would probably be enough as well as chicken.  I didn't mean to sound condescending with the ""female bodies"" comment.  I just know my protein, calorie, supplement intake would differ as we are different weights and have different goals.",1
But I greatly appreciate the feed back!  I just don't want to make some mistake and discourage her from her goals with a one size fits all approach.,1
"At 133 lbs, she only needs 110 g of protein per day and likely doesn't need powder at all to reach that.",1
"Sorry for the long comment but really need adviceI mainly train bodyweight/kettlebells for hypertrophy, I am really curious about programming and have enough of buying online programs, I tried to design my own but they’re always ineffective and/or don’t know how to progress: I want to be able to know how to workout and especially progress long term despite my situation (i.e. home gym, dumbbells only, bands only, calisthenics, full gym, 3-day,2-day, 4-day available, time constraints..).I know more less the logics behind Hypertrophy training like stay in the 5-15 rep range (even if now even 20-25 are accepted?), do around 3-4 sets per exercise, structure the routine by movement patterns (Horizontal and Vert. Push Pull, Squat Hinge patterns and a bit of core) and try to progress by reps, then sets etc.But now I discovered periodisation and I’m quite confused. Therese periodisation with strength in mesocycles, alternating strength and hypertrophy days that progress in different ways, doing a first half of the workout strength while the rest hypertrophy…. I’m lost. Where can I find thorough but simple explanation of these methods with examples? Also I discovered Intensity methods (Supersets, Gian sets, Rest-pause, stripping, dropsets , ladders, EDT, EMOMS etc) and wondering where should I add them and where not, cause when using limited equipment many fitness influencers use them (like superseding pull-ups with bands pullover or doing dropsets with dumbbells chest press), so when are they necessary? Some people say bodyweight can’t build muscle, same for resistance bands, TRX, KB and dumbbells, and then the next day someone else says the contrary and sells a program. Same goes with time: until yesterday it was at least 1.5h in the gym, then watching nippers I saw he just created a 2/day 45min split… again I’m confused and need reputable and understandable sources.",1

Incoming rant..,1
"Got an injury late December and haven't been able to deadlift since, only this week did I feel able to.",1
"So, I hit shoulders on Monday, and woke up Tuesday with a cold. Been dealing with that since. Haven't done any other workouts this week, and still feel out of it (cough, sneeze, runny nose).",1
"I know the responsible thing is to sit out going to the gym until I'm better, but the feeling of guilt is overwhelming - and I worry I'm losing gains haha",1
"I already had to drop my deadlift TM by like 50lbs, just don't want to lose more strength elsewhere by missing a week.",1
Friendly strangers: provide me validation that I'll be fine to resume the gym next week? Haha,1
5 years from now you will not be staring at yourself in the mirror furiously lamenting that one week you took off in 2023.,1
That's exactly what I needed to hear haha,1
"dont listen to eric, the week I missed in the summer of 2018 still haunts me to this day. Dont make the same mistake I did!",1
"I posted a form video of my deadlift, can anyone give me some advice",1
my advice - be patient :),1
Sorry still learning the way this sub works,1
"no worries, there are fewer people who advise on form checks so you just have to wait a little bit for someone to come along, but in my experience almost all of them get advice",1
Appreciate the feedback thanx,1
Can somebody help me understand why i finally got bigger but got weaker?,1
"After years of balanced programs like those from Eric Helms, tbh i looked almost dyel with big tits and thighs. Slightly better. Chest, back and legs looked decent. Arms and delts, i was kind of imbarresed to tell people i was lifting for 3 years because they lookes barely better than when i started",1
"I knew i needed something new. I started listening more to John Meadows and Mike israetel. Swapped all barbells to dumbells mostly, cabels a bit less, and some machines. Left 3 sets of barbell bench presses once a week,  and 3 sets barbell RDL twice a week, thats all.",1
"Started blasting lateral raises and rear delts 4 times a week. Bi’s and tri’s 3 times a week  each for total 15 sets each weekly. Some of the sets pure pump work like Meadows preaches, which seems frown upponed here with just straight sets, long rest and progressive overload with weight increase  And a lot of excercises ive lost some strength lately. But the gains have been insane in just a couple of months. My delts arms, look really good and finally on level with my torso. I really in a short time, love my entire upper body after 3 years of barely making any gains on delts and arms. Chest and back got even better too with volume icreases. 18 sets back, 16 chest  So whats going in?",1
"I though the stronger the you get, the bigger you get. Everywhere on reddit sais so. Well i didnt make any good gains while i managed to get stronger and i got pretty strong. Now im actually getting weaker a little bit, but insane gains. More in a couple of months than last years",1
"Any guesses?  And yes, i always bulked until fat then cut. Countes calories and slept well.",1
Last question. Does people preach too much barbell strength stuff to guys looking for pure hypertrophy and misleading them? Or am i just a non responder?,1
Does people preach too much barbell strength stuff to guys looking for pure hypertrophy and misleading them?,1
I think the difference between dumbbell and barbell compounds is basically negligible.,1
"Your question seems like it answers itself. You increased arm, shoulder, back, and chest volume and you saw these areas grow. This has nothing to do with using barbells or not. You can do high volume training with a barbell too.",1
"I feel like there is bad advice everywhere, but it's also feel like there is plenty of common sense advice on this sub. Most people will say if you want a body part to grow and it hasn't been, you should increase volume. Whether you do that by increasing volume using a barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells, or machines doesn't particularly matter.",1
"Pretty cool story bro, which I enjoyed reading.",1
"But rule 5 applies, we are not allowed to give medical/injury advice, better to seek a professional/specialist.",1
"You’ll want to see an ortho. There are ligaments that hold your knee together, and a big ol donut of cartilage called the meniscus, and these can definitely tear in injuries like the one you describe. Get it checked out and see what’s going on and whether you need surgery. Whatever happens at least you have a cool story to tell.",1

Been lifting for a while and this started d happening after my sets. The redness seems to be permanent throughout the day. I have actually reduced the weight I've been using so not sure why this is happening now. Any suggestions? Is it just me getting old?,1
https://imgur.com/a/kt6cLcw,1
"From a medical standpoint: It’s petechia, busted capillaries right at the skin’s surface. Pretty common on the face/neck with straining, coughing really hard, vomiting, pretty much anything that puts a lot of blood and pressure in the area. The petechia itself isn’t dangerous and icing it will make it go away faster because it’s essentially like a really superficial bruise. That said, try not to strain your face so hard when you lift. Easier said than done, I know but that’ll clear it up.",1
Thank you for that. Been lifting for a while but this first happened to me the end of December. Maybe I changed my form/focus without realizing it,1
How does one strain one's face while lifting?,1
"The same way you do when you’re having trouble taking a shit. Bearing down, holding your breath, forcing all the blood into your face. All that pressure you’re creating in your body, while kind of helpful for lifting something heavy or forcing out a massive turd, it’s not great for you otherwise and can pop those blood vessels under the skin. You ever see any of those videos where dudes lift real heavy and they’ve got red face, veins popping out because they’re struggling with the lift and all that? Yeah, like that. The petechia isn’t a problem, what causes it though… weeellll, I’ve seen some things. Poopers turning into poppers. Extreme cases obviously but best to avoid it if you can. Lol.",1
"At this point I feel like you’re being intentionally obtuse and I’m not going to argue about it. Key takeaway here: Don’t strain, in general. Have a day friend!",1
Would adding milk to pea protein shakes make it more complete? I am asking because it is about half the price right now.,1
"If you are eating a relatively varied diet, you don't have to worry much about a protein being complete. I mix my pea protein with soy milk because it tastes better.",1
Yes but also completeness of any certain meal is not a big deal if overall throughout the day you have a variety of sources,1
https://youtu.be/UOcbKkznFOg,1
Perfect ill save the money then. Thanks!,1
I would say depends on the rest of your nutrition.,1

"Do you take creatine 7 days a week, or only on the days you train?",1

"I had a routine where I do cardio, then immediately weights, then have a shake with protein and Creatine. Now I do cardio in the morning and weights in the evening. When’s the best time to drink protein, and when is best for Creatine? I’ve been doing Creatine after cardio and protein after evening weights lately. Not sure if that’s the best way?",1
"Protein timing doesn't really matter. Just eat some protein in all your meals and you'll be fine. Creatine doesn't matter either, it doesn't work acutely, it builds up in your system over time, then you continue to take it to maintain that level.",1
It doesn't matter at all,1

This is a discussion to have with your doctor.,1
"I'm just interested in hearing different perspectives. When you don't feel like working out, what gets you motivated to follow through on your commitment on those days?",1
Edit: I think using the word motivation isn’t good. I would rephrase my question as what keeps you disciplined to follow through on your commitment on those days.,1
"If I'm having a rough day, I don't have to do the whole workout. I can just do the most important lift. And after I've done that, maybe I'll feel like doing some more, or even the whole routine.",1
I think motivation is unrelated to it if it's a commitment.,1
"But to answer your question, I aim to ignore whether I actually feel like going, and just go. I have yet to regret it.",1
Habit.,1
"Don't think about going to the gym. Go have breakfast, drink your pre/coffee whatever, put your shoes on. Now do you feel like going? You probably decide at this point yeah what the hell let's go.",1

Habit. I never feel like working out,1

Sometimes I get up and think for a few minutes about just going back to sleep, but usually if that happens, I know I just need to get out of the bed and I'll feel better and ready to go to the gym.",1
"If its my scheduled day to go, I go and I go as early as possible to just get it out the way, I'm way past motivation now",1

"Also, on the days you feel like not working out, are usually the days when you have your best workouts.",1
"habit and routine.  generally, when it's workout time on workout day i suit up and go, without thinking about it.",1

"then it's time for some self talk.  i remind myself that working out does wonders for my mental state, and i always feel better after going to the gym, and doing a half assed work out is better than no workout at all, and it's perfectly okay to do a half assed workout sometimes, and some of my best workouts have been on days i didn't want to work out at all",1
"i also tell myself to stop being a wimp.  man up!  i remind myself of the examples of navy SEALS and arctic explorer Shackleton.  seriously, they were ten times more tired and worn out than i'll ever be and they kept going (seriously.  so much of working out is about pushing yourself a bit... doing one more rep, etc.)",1

I am doing great on the run and situps, but the push ups are killing me.

I like the ab wheel. It's a $10 piece of equipment that can give you a great core workout.,1

I’m trying to get back into shape. I have changed my diet and I am eating much healthier. I want to lose weight but gain some muscle. Should I focus more on cardio or weightlifting? Do I need to get in shape before I start building more muscle?,1
You should read the wiki.,1
"Short answer is: You can and probably should do both. You don't need to get ""in shape"" before you start lifting weights.",1
"Pre-covid I was working out pretty regularly. I started lifting in 2017 I think and was consistent until March 2020. I started with 5/3/1 for Beginners, then 5/3/1 BBB, then Bigger Leaner Stronger, and then PHUL.",1
I haven’t worked out since COVID and I’m pushing myself to get back in shape. I gained A LOT of weight during covid. I picked back up with BLS just to start while I figure out where I want to go.,1
And that’s where I’m getting lost/confused. When I was working out before I had strength and I had put on muscle. My arms were stretching out the sleeves of my t-shirts and I loved that.,1

"BUT I'm very skinny still (5' 11"" and 130 lbs) and would like to gain a lot more muscle, especially in my upper body / arms. I look like a prime ""do you even lift"" candidate right now. So I'm considering doing metallaicadpa ppl which is designed for beginners so i can bulk up a bit.",1
"My concern is I'm not quite a beginner (bench 1rm = body weight, squat and dl close to 1.5x bodyweight) so maybe i will stall out quickly in the beginner ppl and I should choose a different program?",1
Appreciate any advice and it would be great to hear from people who were in a similar situation. Thank you.,1
You can gain muscle on any program as long as you're eating enough + protein and progressive overload.,1
Just pick a program that you're going to stick to.,1
Leaving gym bag in the car in the winter. Will this ruin or mess up my lifting belt?,1
"It's fine. It's most likely leather. I'm in central canada and cold does nothing to the belt, other than make it chilly when I first put it on.",1
When squatting when should I wear a lifting belt. When doing 135lb?,1
When you feel like it. I start wearing mine at about 60% of my max. There is a benefit to training beltless as others have stated too.,1
When you feel it will help you with your bracing.,1
"If you have flat feet and squat, and have limited ankle mobility. Doing ass-to-grass squats. Internally are you messing anything up or it's fine if you keep the form? Also using innov 8 which have heel drop and provide stability. To a flat feet that doesn't have stability.",1
If you have the ranges of motion available to do it then it's probably fine.,1
Was taking quite a lot of preworkout but finally stopped and went cold Turkey for 3 weeks. One thing I noticed though is that I'm sweating a lot more during my workouts.

what program are you following?,1
I feel my right knee it's kinda dull idk,1
What does that mean?,1
I am not sure what you mean by dull. Do you have a knee injury? In general using your knees strength training and plyometrics is good for your joints and no special precautions are needed.,1
Would you guys drive/bike further to get to a better gym? In a busy city. Probably about a 20-30 minute commute to this gym. Great facilities. Opening times aren’t ideal. There’s one closer to me that’s pretty awesome too just not as much space.,1
"Should you join the inconvenient gym that you're not going to go to, or join the more convenient gym that's better?",1
"The most important part is that you do it. As a college student I had a 40 minute drive by bus to my gym, but I had the time and motivation to actually do it 3 times a week (and the lack of money forcing me into a cheaper gym). Nowadays I know I wouldn't do that so I go to one that's closer, nicer and more expensive. It all depends on you. If the shorter way means going more often, this one is the better gym.",1
Very very great point. And the closer gym is awesome too. Just way less space to play and I’m more in to bodybuilding and the equipment lacks a little of that flair while the other is super stacked with it. The clientele is also different. Which again is ok. I’m too early most of the time to interact with anyone. Still just a different vibe though. But I’m a rat. I’ll be at the gym bright and early no matter where it is.,1
"Distance is the most important factor for me. I had a gym 2 miles from my house and it was fantastic. That closed sadly.

I’m around 20% body fat (M). In order to get toned abs (not necessarily six pack but definition) should I focus more on losing weight over building muscle? Would it help to continue resistance training on abs while I’m at a maintenance intake or even a small calorie deficit?,1
focus more on losing weight,1
this,1
Would it help to continue resistance training on abs while I’m at a maintenance intake or even a small calorie deficit?,1
"yes, resistance train while in a calorie deficit for best results",1
Visible abs are all in body fat percentage. If you do want visible abs you should go on a cut. Resistance training abs while doing so isn’t going to hurt but it won’t make a huge difference,1

What are the biggest tracking mistakes that people usually make?,1
Not counting cooking oils in their food intake. Usually adds up to an extra couple hundred calories of fat that people fail to include.,1
"Two big ones, already mentioned, but worth repeating. They can sound contradictory on the surface but both are true.",1
"1). Not tracking everything. Oil used in cooking, drinks in general (even a splash of creamer/sugar), and often treating vegetables as calorie free can all add up to enough to stifle progress.",1
"2). Over-obsessing about tracking everything/micro managing. People who do track tend to go overboard, trying to weight every gram, weight everything raw, recalculating everything every time the cook to account for every variation. This burns most people out. The most important thing about calorie tracking is the consistency and being able to meaningfully alter your diet to your goals.",1
"Even if you don't track perfectly and your 1800 is 1875 or your 500 calorie deficit is really 610, if you measure consistently the relative change will work out over time. Its more about consistency and accountability than a hard physics equation of energy in-out.",1
Not making adjustments when the scale doesn't change as expected. Most people under count and are perplexed they aren't losing weight when in reality they just aren't being accurate enough,1
Not tracking.,1
"Spending too much time worrying about the small things - ""how do I track the crumbs in the bottom of the bag of chips??""",1
And not enough focus on that it's a tool to help you meet your long term goals,1
tracking what? calories? weight? sets/reps? prs?,1
Trying out a 1-rep max immediately after a hypertrophy program and thinking the program didn't work because your 1-rep max went down or didn't improve.,1
EDIT: Wrote this before they clarified this was about calories.,1
Is it just me or does GZCLP feel like it lacks hamstring and core work? Should I include a few sets per workout?,1
"As written, it doesn't hit hamstrings any less than it hits chest or quads.",1
"It doesn't have any direct core work, but you can add that and any hamstring isolation work in your T3s.",1
"It lacks direct core/hamstring work, but they're worked indirectly with the main compound lifts.",1
"With any program, you have the freedom to add in assistance work if you have time for it and you don't think it's messing with the program's intentions.",1
https://www.saynotobroscience.com/gzclp-infographic/,1
Read through this.,1
"If you want to add extra isolation exercises, you can do so if your recovery and work capacity allows for it. That said, I don't think GZCLP lacks anything as-is to make good progress for new lifters. Your hamstrings are getting hammered by squats and deadlifts, and your core is being worked during compounds as well.",1
"As the lifter makes progress, I would turn the pulling exercises a T2 movement (3 sets of 10) and superset it with the second. This allows the lifter to build and improve work capacity. Doing the previous point would then leave room for one to two isolation exercises at the end of each workout for 1-3 sets of 10-15 reps each just because getting a pump is awesome and won’t hurt anyone if it’s done in moderation. I personally prefer adding abs on squat day, biceps/triceps on OHP day, lateral raises on bench day, and calf raises on deadlift day. I would do the base workouts for 2-3 weeks when starting out, then gradually add them in 1 set at a time as per Cody’s recommendations.",1
"What causes the weight disparity in my lifts? I got back into fitness again, I benched 60kg today easily but it failed to do an incline press with 10kg dumbbells. I know mechanics involved are different but this is an example. Point is, I seem significantly weaker with dumbbells or other one arm/side exercises. I know mechanics of the lift are different but that much difference makes me curious.",1
DBs are harder than a barbell since you have to spend more energy stabilizing the weight,1
an Incline Press is a more mechanically disadvantageous lift than a Bench Press,1
if you did Incline Press after Bench Press then your muscles are fatigued from the first exercise,1
all 3 combined could very easily lead to such a disparity,1
Is a Bulgarian split squat effective if you use a deck instead of a bench?,1
"you mean to rest your leg on? I dont see why that would change the efficacy, its the exact same thing",1
What do you think a bench does that the deck doesn't?,1
Provided the height of the object is comfortable for you and allows you to put all your work and effort down on your front foot... It doesn't matter what that object is.,1
"(Though I gotta say, using something very sharp/hard can be a pain. I literally bought a Bulgarian Split Squat stand for my gym because of how comfy the padded, rotating bar is for my foot.)",1
"Thank you, this really helped! The height is fine, although a trainer told me to only rest my toes on the edge of the deck as opposed to bending my foot on it, which is another reason I was having doubts about using the deck in addition to its height.",1
Can I still make progress with 4 days off rest?,1
Train push/pull/legs+ 4 days off,1
"Working 12-16 hours a day right now to pay back debt. No energy to workout after work, only free on the weekends.",1
You will make more progress doing that than nothing at all.,1
4 days off is not the issue. The issue is that you're working each body part only once a week. Why not do full body work or at least some upper/lower/fullbody hybrid?,1
Better off training full body 3 days a week,1
"Why do push/pull/legs instead of full body, you'll see more progress",1
Can you? Yes. Will it be anything substantial or as fast as you'd like? probably not.,1
I'd do full body since you're only going to be working out your muscles once a week with a PPL split.,1
"How do I engage/make sure I am engaging lats when using machines such as Lat Pulldown or  Seated Row? Like on Pull days when working the back I really feel my muscles working when using free weights, doing exercises such as Bent-over Barbell Row, Dumbbell Row, Shrugs, Deadlift... but when using machines not so much. I do quite a bit of research before trying exercises, like I look through a lot of videos to really try to perfect the form, etc. But I just don't feel by back working when pull on the machines. If anything my arms become sore. Any ideas?",1
Thank you,1
"Whether you feel them or not, it is physically impossible to complete a single rep of lat pulldown or seated rows with out engaging your lats.  I mean, you can play around with grip width and stretching and all the advice you've been given but at the end of the day you are going to be using your lats when you perform those movements.",1
If you're using the lat pulldown or seated row you are engaging your lats.,1
"The advice that you have to keep your elbows in, or to do a lat spread first, is bad advice. The lat is a large muscle that has a long attachment to the spine and therefore the angle of the muscle fibers varies.",1
"If you are adducting your humerous (pulling your arm down) either in front of your body or to the side, you are using your lats.",1
"With back muscles trying to get so specific about which exercise targets which muscle is totally pointless unless you are a high level body builder. Pull in multiple planes and in multiple directions. Do horizontal pulling, vertical pulling, pulling with both neutral, pronated, and supinated grip, pull with your elbows in and your elbows out. All your back muscles (including rear delt) will be worked and you don't have to micromanage which muscle is doing what at what time.",1
"Your back muscles naturally work in synergy, so don't worry about targeting the feeling to an exact location in your back. My $0.02.",1

"Funny you ask, I found this video yesterday and its excellent",1
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zQFyIWak8K8,1
"I had the same problem, after some research this is what I did.",1
-make sure to either stretch the lats or contract and really feel them (I never tried this),1
"- do a warmup set before each exercise, and strictly focus on feeling and really stretching the lats, and then squeeze the lats and arms at the bottom position (lat pull down as an example) I find thats its easier to feel the lats when im solely focusing on feeling them not on the weight, and when you feel them in one set I find that I'll feel them in the later sets as well",1
- This one I saw on TikTok and its probably just a placebo but try placing your thumb over the bar instead of under it like you normally would,1
"-try the cable pullover, you can really really feel it when doing it with correct form",1
"For lats its all about keeping your arms very close to your torse. Lats require a narrow pull. If youre feeling it in your arms more, what I would suggest is increase the flexion of your elbows so you are at maybe a 90 degree angle.",1
Try to engage your lats by doing a front lat spread (flexing) while doing the movement,1
"Why can I do 7 perfect form chinups with full range of motion, chin over the bar back to a dead hang, and yet I can't do a single pull up from a deadhang (my biceps aren't strong or big in comparaison to other muscles)",1
Chin ups - more bicep engagement,1
Pull ups - more lower traps engagement,1
Your biceps are better at being engaged with this movement than your lower traps.,1
Pull ups engage your back more than a chin up. They’re of course similar but pull ups definitely take way more back strength to do,1
"How long have you done chinups, and how long have you done pullups?",1
"I already have a low body fat and lower weight, I got 12% of body fat today at the doctor, however for some reason I still have some ‘tummy’ and thighs, and I thought by now I would have gotten rid of the grease in this parts, is the solution to focus on working these areas or to keep reducing my body fat?",1
"Edit: However don’t get me wrong, I have significantly reduced my stomach and thigh fat, but I still have some, it’s not a lot but comparing to other parts of my body that are already ‘skinny’ it’s weird, and also consider that I just started training muscles last week, currently I’m ‘skinny’.",1
"However they did that body fat % reading is inaccurate. But if you're already at a low weight and feel you have fat still on you... You are skinny fat. Or in other words, you are under muscled. You need to eat more and start working out before trying to cut back down in weight again.",1
How muscular are you?,1
"If very high muscle, you can keep reducing body fat.",1
"If very low muscle, build muscle. It's easier to lose that fat with lots of muscle.",1
You cannot target any specific area. Where your body stores fat is genetic. First to gain and last to lose.,1
You just don't have any muscle.,1
"I work a 9-5 desk job and genuinely struggle with my love handles, they are beyond stubborn no matter how much weight I lose. Gotta remember those are the first places to gain fat and are therefore the last places to lose it from. You can’t target fat loss just gotta stay the course and keep working it’ll come off eventually.",1

Just go again when you are ready.,1

Is there a reason why powerblocks feel lighter than real dumbbells? I always have to decrease the weight by 5lb on regular dumbbells to hit the same reps as powerblocks,1
"powerblocks tend to be larger than most dumbbells so the weight is spread out on a larger area, so normal dbs are more dense which we often perceive as heavier",1
Distribution of weight maybe?,1
maybe it's like handle grip?,1
How do you consistently keep track of your reps? I tend to lose count in the middle of a set.,1
I use my outbreath to quietly say the number out loud.,1
"just put more conscious effort into the counting, you could also try saying it out loud but I could understand not wanting to do this in a public gym",1
"I count in my head. But I would recommend the Strong app. Use the free version for some time and see if you like it, you can mock up a workout plan with reps, sets and rest times. Very good app!",1
Seconded on Strong. I’d be completely lost at the gym without it lol,1
Mentally count in sets of 3-5. It tricks your brain in a good way as well.,1
"I count like you would keep time in music. 1-2-3-4, 2-2-3-4, 3-2-3-4, 4-2-3-4.",1

I‘m currently bulking but I will cut for summer. Problem is I will have a surgery and can’t workout for 1 month (I can decide when). When should I do the 1 month break? in the bulk or in the cut? or exactly in between?,1
Anytime I can't train becomes a maintenance break. I don't want to bulk if I can't train because that is just getting fat. I don't want to cut it I can't train because I don't want to lose muscle.,1
Doing it during the bulk will be more forgiving if your goal is to keep muscle rather than to lose weight,1
"I would try to eat close to maintenance during the 1 month you can't exercise.  If you have a lot of fat to lose a cut may not be bad.  I would not bulk while not exercising, you're literally only gonna add fat.",1
I am taking a look at the Juggernaut AI app with the free trial. I love the looks of the Powerbuilding program and love how there seems to be so much customization! Has anyone used this app for programming during their bulk? Is Powerbuilding a good type of programming to build or should I find a pure hypertrophy program?,1
I also purchased the SBS bundle which also looks great.,1
Can anyone compare one to the other? I like how the JuggernautAI app is so customized and has everything figured out for you. But the SBS programs also look great and then don’t come with the monthly app fee.,1
Any comparison on the 2 for bulking. I will do whatever one will give me best results for my goals!,1

I say work on your conditioning for sure. You should not be gassed after 3 sets of squats. I'm running Deepwater at the moment which programs 10 sets of squats on Mondays and I don't ever get to the point of puking.,1
Don't work so hard.,1

I'm currently 5""11, 90KG, Male, 17, do 10K steps a day, and in a caloric deficit of 1,200 calories. Reaching around 180-240g of protein a day. My goal is to go from my current body fat (a weighing machine says I'm around 25%) and trying to get lean. I want muscle at the same time. I started around 5 months ago at 135 KG.",1
I can do around 14kg each dumbbell for bench press (6-7 reps usually),1
40-45KG on Leg Presses,1
Still trying to learn the weights as I just started this plan 2 weeks ago introducing new workouts to me so I didn't know what weights to use.,1
The plan as a google doc.,1

"Since I've had time over the break I have been running the Reddit PPL over 6 days a week .With work now back and time constrained am I able to continue to run the reddit PPL over 5 days, with the ""6th""day being the first of the following week as I don't think I'll be able to get to the gym 6 days. Or is it recommended to change to a 5 day plan? If it helps my goal is to lose fat and I am running a calorie deficit.",1
Thanks!,1
I run a 6 day PPL and go to the gym 4-6 days a week. I just go when I can go and hit the next workout in order. When I feel like I need a rest day I take one. Don’t overthink it.,1
I ran it that way for 6 months last year made a lot of progress.,1
Hey I was wondering if anyone knew a cheap place to buy bumper plates? I've been looking around the typical places and the prices seem insane!,1
Probably used on Facebook or Craigslist or something.,1
Just keep checking Facebook marketplace. Took me months but I got a hell of a deal on some rogue echos,1
"I’m currently trying to lean bulk. I am 175lbs at 5’10. I have basketball practice 5 days a week so I’m eating around 3900 calories a day. In my weight charts, in 11 days, I’ve gone from 172.4 to 175.1. Is that to quick of a bulk? I’m trying to get to 185.",1
11 days isn’t really long enough of a time period to definitively determine whether the bulk is too large. Have you estimated your TDEE? How big is your surplus?,1
"lately ive been doing jim wendler’s 5/3/1 boring but big, but it seems like i have seen more success with jim wendlers 5/3/1 for the beginners when i first started. am i doing anything wrong and should i switch programs? also what does yall split routine look like? thanks!",1
but it seems like i have seen more success,1
How are you measuring success?,1
what does yall split routine look like,1
"I do a 3-part full body split and rotate ABC every other day. So I complete a ""week"" every 6 days. I'm using the Stronger By Science hypertrophy template.",1
"You'll always make faster progress on beginner routines. But that progress eventually runs out, which if why you don't stay on them forever",1
BBB is slow progress in the form of total weight progression but you should be setting regular rep PR’s and it’s definitely improving your work capacity. In the newest book (Forever) Jim recommends doing an “anchor” cycle after the “leader” (in your case BBB) which is generally done with lower volume and higher intensity to utilize all the muscle you’ve built on the high volume program.,1
I am currently doing 531 1000% awesome 3 times a week alongside lots of conditioning.,1
