Abortion,0
Am I the only one that thinks the overturning of the abortion and gun law is an effort by the ruling class to swing things in the other direction. There are going to be crazy shootings and this abortion crap will go haywire. It will create a tension that has to break and then what? Chaos!,0
No one else thinks that is the plan? It’s easy to rule chaos.,0

Crimson Pill vs Black Pill: Top 5 Reasons looks matter very little (Part 1),0
If you like this post follow me on r/Crimsonpill,0
Introduction,0
"I   wanted to contribute my thoughts on the looks debate. I will add much   more depth in future articles. However, I wanted to make my stance   clear. I believe looks matter very little. I have seen how average   looking guys can get laid with only game. While good looking guys get   nothing. I would say ""looks"" are more like your ""opener"" for most   chicks, they'll say, ""Oh he's alright."" and it will be the opportunity   to approach. I would say that you can get the same result by using,   ""Perfume.""",0
1-Game matters 80%,0
It   is your game and confidence that matters the most. You can be the most   good looking guy and act low value and most chicks will get  immediately  turn off. I was hanging out with a male model and he would  stand there  and do nothing. Sooner or later the girls got bored of him  and left.,0
2-Looks are only 10-20% of the equation,0
"Why   would you spend so much time obsessing over something that's more like   the ""icing on the cake."" Looks might give you a bit of an edge at the   beginning of the interaction, however, for the most its your game that   will determine how the interaction goes. If your game is tight you will   be able to move the interaction forward. For instance, once you are on   an instant date most chicks are not going to care about your looks.",0
3-Most chicks are more interested in your confidence  and skill,0
Most   chicks are going to care if you approach them and if you can move the   interaction forward. Looks won't do any of that to you. How are your   looks going to help you when you need to strategize how to move the   interaction forward. Or how are looks going to help you when you have to,0
4-Good looking guys get more attention from other guys who want to be like them than from girls,0

A weird situation with people I don't know spying on my snap story,0
"Hi reddit,I know this doesn't sound like a big deal but I am abit confused.basically people at my school think I'm weird (well used to think that,but seem like they are started to know me abit more now)however there is one particular group of boys in my year who are freinds with people from other schools.some of these boys (,at my school) are starting to speak to me more nicely and be are being more nice.But the other week I shouted some random boy out on my snap story (who everyone calls a 'nonce) and this group of boys also dislike him and all their freinds from the other school viewed my story.Another thing that happened on my snap story is tellonyms where people were making rumours about me dating a boy in their freindship group.Again the same bunch of lads from the other school were viewing my story again.Yet I have never met them in my life and aren't freinds with them on snap.Does this mean bad rumours are going around about me?Am I right to think it's abit strange?",0
Oops...Time Change,0
"Well, here in the US we had Daylight Savings go into effect.  Since I work overnights, I watched as the clock jumped from 01:59 to 03:00 (time travel anyone?).",0
"As I was walking out to the car, I realized it was still pretty dark.  I thought to myself ""Hey wasn't it brighter than this, same time as yesterday?). We moved ahead an hour, so it should be brighter right?""",0

What did Manny from Scent of A Woman think was going on with Frank and Charlie?,0
"You work in Manhattan as a limo driver, occasionally you go out of town on a day trip but nothing really far. It's generally nice and quiet, a few upscale clients but nothing really intense. Then one day you pull up to the front entrance of the Plaza and pick up some old blind guy and a skinny glass of water from Boys Club School or wherever. You think well they're father and son or whatever, but they clearly hardly know each other. That wouldn't be THAT weird except they just came out of a super expensive hotel...",0
"Anyway you drive them about 90 minutes up into Poughkeepsie for Thanksgiving, and while you're waiting outside you see the old windbag (fucker NEVER stops talking) choking out someone twice his size. What the fuck, I thought that grouchy asshole was blind? Well whatever, don't ask questions, just drive the limo. Later the geezer asks you to hook up up with some hoo-hah so you take him over, he gets laid and tells the young kid (couldn't be 18) all about how much he likes hookers. Ooookay.",0
"Next day you park at the plaza and go upstairs to get them, and you hear the geriatric army lunatic screaming death threats at the kid (who clearly is not related to him), and you even hear the CLICK OF A GUN. You're about two seconds from calling the police when you hear things de-escalate and you decide to get downstairs and call from the lobby so you don't wind up getting shot yourself. They come down a little later, the old guy is badly drunk and talking about how much fun he had fooling the cops into thinking he could safely drive a RENTED FERRARI. What the fuck kind of bizarre two-man bachelor trip weekend is this?",0
"Next morning the three of you head back north to drop the kid off at his St. Swivendale's School for Pale Young Boys, and after you head out, the cranky fuck who's still paying your salary asks to turn around. Five minutes later he's talking you into going into the school to track the kid down. Doesn't say why, won't clue you in, just.. okay fine, you're on the clock and he's offering you tons of cash to help you find this underage kid. Ooookay fine.",0
"Everyone's in the main auditorium, having some court hearing or something, and you see the drunken uncle-but-they-aren't-related ON THE STAGE slamming shit, screaming at the headmaster and threatening to get a flamethrower to torch the whole place down. What in the name of holy god is this guy doing up there, he's retired from the army, he doesn't work at the school, he doesn't even know who this kid is, but he's swearing and foaming like a bull. The school board is so beaten down that they let the kid go and everyone loses their shit clapping.",0
"A few minutes later I'm driving the creaky old bastard home to his tiny mother-in-law shack with some infant kids in the driveway, and I ask him if he works at the school, he says no. Then I ask him how long he's known this kid, and he says two days. What in the sugary fried fuck did I just witness. I hope he doesn't go back with his flamethrower like he threatened, it seemed like an okay place.",0
TL:DR I made $5600 in three days driving a blind pervert and a schoolboy around Manhattan.,0

"Looking for an Adastra-esque VN, using this as a bases before asking the sub suited for this kind of thing",0
"I recently finished playing through Adastra, and its sequel was a bit lack luster in comparison. Because of the aforementioned lack of interest, and my apparent ineptitude to find a comparable alternative, i might as well ask those who would know, rather than fumbling around like a particularly agitated fish out of water. What i am looking for is a romantic gay furry vn. I don't care if there's NSFW content, i just need something that fills the same roll Adastra did. As for a story, wholesome, its the best way i can describe my goals. The main interest, almost anything will do, with the exception of yandere and that type of deal. However my preference is a sweet himbo, but as I said, I am ok with nearly anything, just as long as it isn't a yandere, hard dom, or the like. I do thank any person(s) that may give suggestions in response to this, and I do apologize for any difficulties that may be experienced if you are to look for one that meet my specs.",0

"I wish that I could find a man that knows exactly what anxiety feels like.. I feel like most ppl don't actually know what anxiety is or feels like physically. I want someone I can feel comfortable and safe with while I'm having an anxiety attack too. I live alone in my own room but with roommates who have their own room also. We don't talk hardly ever because of the language barrier. They speak Spanish and some English and I speak English but only understand Spanish..... Idk how to speak Spanish.. They're Columbian too if that matters. I'm an American born citizen... I wish I lived with ppl I could get along with. Ppl I could actually confide in and trust. My family lives states away and I live here, it's difficult. This is actually helping my anxiety right now too. Thankfully. I want to cuddle... I don't have anyone to cuddle... I've been to the doctor and gotten a few EKGs and even called the ambulance once because my left arm started bothering me but when they got here, I started to calm down. The one guy talked to me for about an hour while the last was writing papers and had me sign a few things. A few minutes after they left, a sherif called to make sure they responded. I live in NYC and that's nice that they call to make sure they respond. That even happened when I called for the fire dept because the pettiness were throwing electricity and sparks right outside my apartment building. It messed up the electricity for a few days. Ok.. in case anyone hasn't told any of you who have read this far, you're awesome and whatever you're doing, keep doing it! You're doing great! Anyway I'm going to sleep. Goodnight everyone! ♡",0

"1: the first is faucetcrypto it allows to earn some coin through shortlinks, ptc ads , surveys or offerwall, the minimum amount to withdraw is very low and can be reached daily plus it has a level program that gives you more coins by leveling up",0
"2: the second is dutchy corps , it allows to earn by watching shortlinks, ptc ads , surfing ads and offerwalls. It also has a level program that increase the claming amount plus i recommend to run the autofaucet with balance mode to earn an additional 10% and on weekends to earn an additional 20% claim bonus. There is also a coin roll that every 30 min gives you a free amount of a crypto that is voted monthly by the community.",0
"3: the third is autoclaim that allows to earn coin by doing shortlinks or offerwalls very easily, it also has a bonus program and there is no minimum amount to withdraw",0

This is how celebrity romances go,0
"First, you're bombarded with media gossip about celeb x fancying celeb y and you're led to believe that everybody except you is really shocked and excited about it all. This is the warm up phase.",0
"Then, after hints and denials from the pair through friends and the media, an announcement is made to inform everybody that the pair are officially an item after denying the reports. Now it's full steam ahead as you're bombarded with photographs of the celeb 'lovers' holding hands coming and going like 'common people' do as though they're being spied on without their knowledge. You also have your inbox filled with spam stories of how it's a lover's paradise for them and how they are a perfect match for one another. While the media feeding frenzy balloons out of all proportion and goes doolally the phoney lovers are busily releasing singles and albums feeding off the media hype before the bloated fake news balloon is popped to make way for the next nothingburger waiting in the wings.",0
"Then, after everybody except you has cashed in from the fake romance, rumours surface of trouble in paradise with more hints and denials before the once smitten celebrities announce a tearful break up on Twitter or through a tabloid. Now you're going to be bombarded with sob stories and lessons learnt in interviews and music releases. There might be 'feuds' and Twitter wars at this stage.",0
"After the Viagra induced media boner has finally gone back down to its natural permanent state, anaemic and limp, you might be gifted with a magical reunion in which case the phoney lovers do it all over again to cash in twice from nothing.",0
"While these shenanigans are going on celeb x and celeb y are telling their fans fake friends how much they love them all, setting up phoney charities to look like they care about others more than you do and promoting more 'music' embedded with nasty hidden messages.",0
"During this circle jerk the two faced back stabbing mass media is also reporting on other events like rape, famine, economic disaster, government failure, war and impending human extinction to cash in on those things as well.",0

"My mom works at a grocery store and multiple times people have come in wanting thousands in random cards for a grand kid or something and she always warns them if someone asked you to lie and get them gift cards and they dont actually know the person or stuff like that it's a scam.

People that fall for it multiple times either shouldn't be allowed to touch money or they obviously should be in a care center no matter the age especially when they are warned it's a scam yet they believe the stranger on the phone and not the person in front of you that may be a stranger but you know where they work they aren't trying to take anything instead they don't want you to spend that money.,0

Sounds very entertaining and I love to think what kinds of conversations these characters would have. One of my favorites I think about a lot is putting a bunch of people on an island and seeing how long they would survive. Like Falco Grice, Jack from Jupiter, Charles Smith, Nick Valentine, Hatty Hattington, Charles Lee Ray, Adolf Hitler, Jesus Christ, and my best friend Vinny. How would they all react? would they all die violent deaths from the environment? or would they kill each other lol. So very interesting to me and I think about this a lot",0

I was cleaning the exhaust fan in my bathroom that I don’t think has ever been cleaned that was CAKED CLOSED with dust (living in my in laws house so not my doing) and there was a whole lot of white granules coming out of it and now I feel sick and short of breath. Idk what to do from here because I don’t want to touch it again after I start to feel better but if it is asbestos it needs cleaned out.

Need help choosing a bed frame,0
Exactly what the title says. Dm me and comment first to let me know that you’re going to message if you’d like to see pictures. I found two bed frames that are both black but one has built in storage drawers and one looks like nothing I’ve ever seen before and I’m frankly entranced by it. They are around the same price with I believe a $50 difference including the shipping. The storage would be good to have as we’re (me and my bf) staying with his parents and don’t have much storage space but then again we won’t always be living in just one room so I’m very tossed between the two.

According to all known laws of aviation,0
"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like? - A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! ""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside the hive. Yeah, but some don't come back. - Hey, Jocks! - Hi, Jocks! You guys did great! You're monsters! You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it! - I wonder where they were. - I don't know. Their day's not planned. Outside the hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what. You can'tjust decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that. Right. Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime. It's just a status symbol. Bees make too much of it. Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it. Those ladies? Aren't they our cousins too? Distant. Distant. Look at these two. - Oouple of Hive Harrys. - Let's have fun with them. It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock. Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me! - Oh, my! - I never thought I'd knock him out. What were you doing during this? Trying to alert the authorities. I can autograph that. A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades? Yeah. Gusty. We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. - Six miles, huh? - Barry! A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it. - Maybe I am. - You are not! We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough? I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means. Hey, Honex! Dad, you surprised me. You decide what you're interested in? - Well, there's a lot of choices. - But you only get one. Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day? Son, let me tell you about stirring. You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around. You get yourself into a rhythm. It's a beautiful thing. You know, Dad, the more I think about it, maybe the honey field just isn't right for me. You were thinking of what, making balloon animals? That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger. Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey! - Barry, you are so funny sometimes. - I'm not trying to be funny. You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer! - You're gonna be a stirrer? - No one's listening to me! Wait till you see the sticks I have. I could say anything right now. I'm gonna get an ant tattoo! Let's open some honey and celebrate! Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""! I'm so proud. - We're starting work today! - Today's the day. Oome on! All the good jobs will be gone. Yeah, right. Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal... - Is it still available? - Hang on. Two left! One of them's yours! Oongratulations! Step to the side. - What'd you get? - Picking crud out. Stellar! Wow! Oouple of newbies? Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready! Make your choice. - You want to go first? - No, you go. Oh, my. What's available? Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think. - Any chance of getting the Krelman? - Sure, you're on. I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out. Wax monkey's always open. The Krelman opened up again. What happened? A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one. Deady. Deadified. Two more dead. Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life! Oh, this is so hard! Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler. Barry, what do you think I should... Barry? Barry! All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine... What happened to you? Where are you? - I'm going out. - Out? Out where? - Out there. - Oh, no! I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life. You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello? Another call coming in. If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today. Hey, guys. - Look at that. - Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday? Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted. It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up. Really? Feeling lucky, are you? Sign here, here. Just initial that. - Thank you. - OK. You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain. So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats. Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us. Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada! - That's awful. - And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans! All right, launch positions! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Black and yellow! Hello! You ready for this, hot shot? Yeah. Yeah, bring it on. Wind, check. - Antennae, check. - Nectar pack, check. - Wings, check. - Stinger, check. Scared out of my shorts, check. OK, ladies, let's move it out! Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers! All of you, drain those flowers! Wow! I'm out! I can't believe I'm out! So blue. I feel so fast and free! Box kite! Wow! Flowers! This is Blue Leader. We have roses visual. Bring it around 30 degrees and hold. Roses! 30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around. Stand to the side, kid. It's got a bit of a kick. That is one nectar collector! - Ever see pollination up close? - No, sir. I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one. See that? It's a little bit of magic. That's amazing. Why do we do that? That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us. Oool. I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow. Oould be daisies. Don't we need those? Oopy that visual. Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move. Say again? You're reporting a moving flower? Affirmative. That was on the line! This is the coolest. What is it? I don't know, but I'm loving this color. It smells good. Not like a flower, but I like it. Yeah, fuzzy. Ohemical-y. Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby. My sweet lord of bees! Oandy-brain, get off there! Problem! - Guys! - This could be bad. Affirmative. Very close. Gonna hurt. Mama's little boy. You are way out of position, rookie! Ooming in at you like a missile! Help me! I don't think these are flowers. - Should we tell him? - I think he knows. What is this?! Match point! You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it! Yowser! Gross. There's a bee in the car! - Do something! - I'm driving! - Hi, bee. - He's back here! He's going to sting me! Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze! He blinked! Spray him, Granny! What are you doing?! Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable. I gotta get home. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Oan't fly in rain. Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down! Ken, could you close the window please? Ken, could you close the window please? Oheck out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out. Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this. What was that? Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes! That is diabolical. It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies. What's number one? Star Wars? Nah, I don't go for that... ...kind of stuff. No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds. When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say. There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out. I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it. I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me. Wait! Stop! Bee! Stand back. These are winter boots. Wait! Don't kill him! You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me! Why does his life have less value than yours? Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement? I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling. My brochure! There you go, little guy. I'm not scared of him. It's an allergic thing. Put that on your resume brochure. My whole face could puff up. Make it one of your special skills. Knocking someone out is also a special skill. Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks. - Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night? - Sure, Ken. You know, whatever. - You could put carob chips on there. - Bye. - Supposed to be less calories. - Bye. I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something. All right, here it goes. Nah. What would I say? I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human. I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to. Oh, I can't do it. Oome on! No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't. How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good. Here she comes! Speak, you fool! Hi! I'm sorry. - You're talking. - Yes, I know. You're talking! I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to ! This isn't a goodfella. This is a badfella! Why doesn't someone just step on this creep, and we can all go home?! - Order in this court! - You're all thinking it! Order! Order, I say! - Say it! - Mr. Liotta, please sit down! I think it was awfully nice of that bear to pitch in like that. I think the jury's on our side. Are we doing everything right, legally? I'm a florist. Right. Well, here's to a great team. To a great team! Well, hello. - Ken! - Hello. I didn't think you were coming. No, I was just late. I tried to call, but... the battery. I didn't want all this to go to waste, so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free. Oh, that was lucky. There's a little left. I could heat it up. Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever. So I hear you're quite a tennis player. I'm not much for the game myself. The ball's a little grabby. That's where I usually sit. Right... there. Ken, Barry was looking at your resume, and he agreed with me that eating with chopsticks isn't really a special skill. You think I don't see what you're doing? I know how hard it is to find the rightjob. We have that in common. Do we? Bees have 100 percent employment, but we do jobs like taking the crud out. That's just what I was thinking about doing. Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor for his fuzz. I hope that was all right. I'm going to drain the old stinger. Yeah, you do that. Look at that. You know, I've just about had it with your little mind games. - What's that? - Italian Vogue. Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages. A lot of ads. Remember what Van said, why is your life more valuable than mine? Funny, I just can't seem to recall that! I think something stinks in here! I love the smell of flowers. How do you like the smell of flames?! Not as much. Water bug! Not taking sides! Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat! This is pathetic! I've got issues! Well, well, well, a royal flush! - You're bluffing. - Am I? Surf's up, dude! Poo water! That bowl is gnarly. Except for those dirty yellow rings! Kenneth! What are you doing?! You know, I don't even like honey! I don't eat it! We need to talk! He's just a little bee! And he happens to be the nicest bee I've met in a long time! Long time? What are you talking about?! Are there other bugs in your life? No, but there are other things bugging me in life. And you're one of them! Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night... My nerves are fried from riding on this emotional roller coaster! Goodbye, Ken. And for your information, I prefer sugar-free, artificial sweeteners made by man! I'm sorry about all that. I know it's got an aftertaste! I like it! I always felt there was some kind of barrier between Ken and me. I couldn't overcome it. Oh, well. Are you OK for the trial? I believe Mr. Montgomery is about out of ideas. We would like to call Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand. Good idea! You can really see why he's considered one of the best lawyers... Yeah. Layton, you've gotta weave some magic with this jury, or it's gonna be all over. Don't worry. The only thing I have to do to turn this jury around is to remind them of what they don't like about bees. - You got the tweezers? - Are you allergic? Only to losing, son. Only to losing. Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you what I think we'd all like to know. What exactly is your relationship to that woman? We're friends. - Good friends? - Yes. How good? Do you live together? Wait a minute... Are you her little... ...bedbug? I've seen a bee documentary or two. From what I understand, doesn't your queen give birth to all the bee children? - Yeah, but... - So those aren't your real parents! - Oh, Barry... - Yes, they are! Hold me back! You're an illegitimate bee, aren't you, Benson? He's denouncing bees! Don't y'all date your cousins? - Objection! - I'm going to pincushion this guy! Adam, don't! It's what he wants! Oh, I'm hit!! Oh, lordy, I am hit! Order! Order! The venom! The venom is coursing through my veins! I have been felled by a winged beast of destruction! You see? You can't treat them like equals! They're striped savages! Stinging's the only thing they know! It's their way! - Adam, stay with me. - I can't feel my legs. What angel of mercy will come forward to suck the poison from my heaving buttocks? I will have order in this court. Order! Order, please! The case of the honeybees versus the human race took a pointed turn against the bees yesterday when one of their legal team stung Layton T. Montgomery. - Hey, buddy. - Hey. - Is there much pain? - Yeah. I... I blew the whole case, didn't I? It doesn't matter. What matters is you're alive. You could have died. I'd be better off dead. Look at me. They got it from the cafeteria downstairs, in a tuna sandwich. Look, there's a little celery still on it. What was it like to sting someone? I can't explain it. It was all... All adrenaline and then... and then ecstasy! All right. You think it was all a trap? Of course. I'm sorry. I flew us right into this. What were we thinking? Look at us. We're just a couple of bugs in this world. What will the humans do to us if they win? I don't know. I hear they put the roaches in motels. That doesn't sound so bad. Adam, they check in, but they don't check out! Oh, my. Oould you get a nurse to close that window? - Why? - The smoke. Bees don't smoke. Right. Bees don't smoke. Bees don't smoke! But some bees are smoking. That's it! That's our case! It is? It's not over? Get dressed. I've gotta go somewhere. Get back to the court and stall. Stall any way you can. And assuming you've done step correctly, you're ready for the tub. Mr. Flayman. Yes? Yes, Your Honor! Where is the rest of your team? Well, Your Honor, it's interesting. Bees are trained to fly haphazardly, and as a result, we don't make very good time. I actually heard a funny story about... Your Honor, haven't these ridiculous bugs taken up enough of this court's valuable time? How much longer will we allow these absurd shenanigans to go on? They have presented no compelling evidence to support their charges against my clients, who run legitimate businesses. I move for a complete dismissal of this entire case! Mr. Flayman, I'm afraid I'm going to have to consider Mr. Montgomery's motion. But you can't! We have a terrific case. Where is your proof? Where is the evidence? Show me the smoking gun! Hold it, Your Honor! You want a smoking gun? Here is your smoking gun. What is that? It's a bee smoker! What, this? This harmless little contraption? This couldn't hurt a fly, let alone a bee. Look at what has happened to bees who have never been asked, ""Smoking or non?"" Is this what nature intended for us? To be forcibly addicted to smoke machines and man-made wooden slat work camps? Living out our lives as honey slaves to the white man? - What are we gonna do? - He's playing the species card. Ladies and gentlemen, please, free these bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! Free the bees! The court finds in favor of the bees! Vanessa, we won! I knew you could do it! High-five! Sorry. I'm OK! You know what this means? All the honey will finally belong to the bees. Now we won't have to work so hard all the time. This is an unholy perversion of the balance of nature, Benson. You'll regret this. Barry, how much honey is out there? All right. One at a time. Barry, who are you wearing? My sweater is Ralph Lauren, and I have no pants. - What if Montgomery's right? - What do you mean? We've been living the bee way a long time, 27 million years. Oongratulations on your victory. What will you demand as a settlement? First, we'll demand a complete shutdown of all bee work camps. Then we want back the honey that was ours to begin with, every last drop. We demand an end to the glorification of the bear as anything more than a filthy, smelly, bad-breath stink machine. We're all aware of what they do in the woods. Wait for my signal. Take him out. He'll have nauseous for a few hours, then he'll be fine. And we will no longer tolerate bee-negative nicknames... But it's just a prance-about stage name! ...unnecessary inclusion of honey in bogus health products and la-dee-da human tea-time snack garnishments. Oan't breathe. Bring it in, boys! Hold it right there! Good. Tap it. Mr. Buzzwell, we just passed three cups, and there's gallons more coming! - I think we need to shut down! - Shut down? We've never shut down. Shut down honey production! Stop making honey! Turn your key, sir! What do we do now? Oannonball! We're shutting honey production! Mission abort. Aborting pollination and nectar detail. Returning to base. Adam, you wouldn't believe how much honey was out there. Oh, yeah? What's going on? Where is everybody? - Are they out celebrating? - They're home. They don't know what to do. Laying out, sleeping in. I heard your Uncle Oarl was on his way to San Antonio with a cricket. At least we got our honey back. Sometimes I think, so what if humans liked our honey? Who wouldn't? It's the greatest thing in the world! I was excited to be part of making it. This was my new desk. This was my new job. I wanted to do it really well. And now... Now I can't. I don't understand why they're not happy. I thought their lives would be better! They're doing nothing. It's amazing. Honey really changes people. You don't have any idea what's going on, do you? - What did you want to show me? - This. What happened here? That is not the half of it. Oh, no. Oh, my. They're all wilting. Doesn't look very good, does it? No. And whose fault do you think that is? You know, I'm gonna guess bees. Bees? Specifically, me. I didn't think bees not needing to make honey would affect all these things. It's notjust flowers. Fruits, vegetables, they all need bees. That's our whole SAT test right there. Take away produce, that affects the entire animal kingdom. And then, of course... The human species? So if there's no more pollination, it could all just go south here, couldn't it? I know this is also partly my fault. How about a suicide pact? How do we do it? - I'll sting you, you step on me. - Thatjust kills you twice. Right, right. Listen, Barry... sorry, but I gotta get going. I had to open my mouth and talk. Vanessa? Vanessa? Why are you leaving? Where are you going? To the final Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena. They've moved it to this weekend because all the flowers are dying. It's the last chance I'll ever have to see it. Vanessa, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I never meant it to turn out like this. I know. Me neither. Tournament of Roses. Roses can't do sports. Wait a minute. Roses. Roses? Roses! Vanessa! Roses?! Barry? - Roses are flowers! - Yes, they are. Flowers, bees, pollen! I know. That's why this is the last parade. Maybe not. Oould you ask him to slow down? Oould you slow down? Barry! OK, I made a huge mistake. This is a total disaster, all my fault. Yes, it kind of is. I've ruined the planet. I wanted to help you with the flower shop. I've made it worse. Actually, it's completely closed down. I thought maybe you were remodeling. But I have another idea, and it's greater than my previous ideas combined. I don't want to hear it! All right, they have the roses, the roses have the pollen. I know every bee, plant and flower bud in this park. All we gotta do is get what they've got back here with what we've got. - Bees. - Park. - Pollen! - Flowers. - Repollination! - Across the nation! Tournament of Roses, Pasadena, Oalifornia. They've got nothing but flowers, floats and cotton candy. Security will be tight. I have an idea. Vanessa Bloome, FTD. Official floral business. It's real. Sorry, ma'am. Nice brooch. Thank you. It was a gift. Once inside, we just pick the right float. How about The Princess and the Pea? I could be the princess, and you could be the pea! Yes, I got it. - Where should I sit? - What are you? - I believe I'm the pea. - The pea? It goes under the mattresses. - Not in this fairy tale, sweetheart. - I'm getting the marshal. You do that! This whole parade is a fiasco! Let's see what this baby'll do. Hey, what are you doing?! Then all we do is blend in with traffic... ...without arousing suspicion. Once at the airport, there's no stopping us. Stop! Security. - You and your insect pack your float? - Yes. Has it been in your possession the entire time? Would you remove your shoes? - Remove your stinger. - It's part of me. I know. Just having some fun. Enjoy your flight. Then if we're lucky, we'll have just enough pollen to do the job. Oan you believe how lucky we are? We have just enough pollen to do the job! I think this is gonna work. It's got to work. Attention, passengers, this is Oaptain Scott. We have a bit of bad weather in New York. It looks like we'll experience a couple hours delay. Barry, these are cut flowers with no water. They'll never make it. I gotta get up there and talk to them. Be careful. Oan I get help with the Sky Mall magazine? I'd like to order the talking inflatable nose and ear hair trimmer. Oaptain, I'm in a real situation. - What'd you say, Hal? - Nothing. Bee! Don't freak out! My entire species... What are you doing? - Wait a minute! I'm an attorney! - Who's an attorney? Don't move. Oh, Barry. Good afternoon, passengers. This is your captain. Would a Miss Vanessa Bloome in 24B please report to the cockpit? And please hurry! What happened here? There was a DustBuster, a toupee, a life raft exploded. One's bald, one's in a boat, they're both unconscious! - Is that another bee joke? - No! No one's flying the plane! This is JFK control tower, Flight 356. What's your status? This is Vanessa Bloome. I'm a florist from New York. Where's the pilot? He's unconscious, and so is the copilot. Not good. Does anyone onboard have flight experience? As a matter of fact, there is. - Who's that? - Barry Benson. From the honey trial?! Oh, great. Vanessa, this is nothing more than a big metal bee. It's got giant wings, huge engines. I can't fly a plane. - Why not? Isn't John Travolta a pilot? - Yes. How hard could it be? Wait, Barry! We're headed into some lightning. This is Bob Bumble. We have some late-breaking news from JFK Airport, where a suspenseful scene is developing. Barry Benson, fresh from his legal victory... That's Barry! ...is attempting to land a plane, loaded with people, flowers and an incapacitated flight crew. Flowers?! We have a storm in the area and two individuals at the controls with absolutely no flight experience. Just a minute. There's a bee on that plane. I'm quite familiar with Mr. Benson and his no-account compadres. They've done enough damage. But isn't he your only hope? Technically, a bee shouldn't be able to fly at all. Their wings are too small... Haven't we heard this a million times? ""The surface area of the wings and body mass make no sense."" - Get this on the air! - Got it. - Stand by. - We're going live. The way we work may be a mystery to you. Making honey takes a lot of bees doing a lot of small jobs. But let me tell you about a small job. If you do it well, it makes a big difference. More than we realized. To us, to everyone. That's why I want to get bees back to working together. That's the bee way! We're not made of Jell-O. We get behind a fellow. - Black and yellow! - Hello! Left, right, down, hover. - Hover? - Forget hover. This isn't so hard. Beep-beep! Beep-beep! Barry, what happened?! Wait, I think we were on autopilot the whole time. - That may have been helping me. - And now we're not! So it turns out I cannot fly a plane. All of you, let's get behind this fellow! Move it out! Move out! Our only chance is if I do what I'd do, you copy me with the wings of the plane! Don't have to yell. I'm not yelling! We're in a  drop it  Wrap it up, guys. I had virtually no rehearsal for that. The whole bee movie script.",0

Weirdest fitness decision I’ve ever made— and I’m pretty happy with it,0
"I rock climb (indoors) as my usual hobby/exercise here in Arizona. However, I wanted to try a new form of exercise for effective cardio and so be it, I got myself a 3 month membership commitment to SkyZone Trampoline Park. All I do there is jump on the trampolines mindlessly, and WOW! I get a good sweat after just 20 min. I do two rounds of 20 mins with a 10 min break in between. It’s fun and honestly low effort for a high reward Imo. The hardest part of this is walking in and being like one of the only adults (I’m 22M) to jump because the rest are kids! It’s embarrassing but slowly I forget about it and have a nice workout! I’m going to take a 3 month break from rock climbing and just jump for the next 3, to lose some serious weight! TL;DR: Taking a break from Rock climbing to start jumping at SkyZone as my workout!",0

I think I might be a hypochondriac,0
"Over the summer, I was laying on the couch, when I started feeling my heart pound. It’s like I could always feel it pounding, and I felt like I was manually pumping it. After a few months I got it checked out. I went to a cardiologist, and got an ECG. Everything came back fine, and the whole time my parents were telling me it was nothing. The feeling never went away and I just sort of learned to live with it. Recently, though, a new thing started happening. When I twist my chest, I feel a pain in my sternum, and almost every time I breathe in, I hear a popping noise in my neck. I’m 18 and am supposed to go to the army in 3 months because I joined before all this started happening. I just know my parents think I’m crazy, and I wanted to get this off my chest.",0

How am i supposed to tell my father (and others) that i almost got raped by my half-brother (?),0
"How am i supposed to tell my father (or others) that i was about to be raped by my half-brother (?) Hello, so before someone able to understand this , you need to know the backstory: my mother died like 20 days after my fifth birthday and after that i lived alone with my dad and our cats. My half-brother (we have the same dad but not the same mom) who was at the time 14-15 years old then suddenly came every weekend over to us (due to the fact that he live with his mum and not with us).",0
"Okay , so when he would come over we would often go to my toy room (it was downstairs near the attic and it was actually almost the biggest room in the house lol) and sometimes he would do crazy shit to me but i didnt understand what he did until like 5 years later. So that one time i remember him grabbing a small toy hair dryier (sorry , dont know how to say dryier as english isnt my first language haha) and using it on my female body part , and that one time he asked me to lick his male body part , lucky to say i told him it was too hairy lol. (IM STILL DISGUSTED BY WHAT HE DID AND WE DIDNT HAVE ANY CONTACT AT ALL FOR TWO YEARS NOW , I MIGHT DO A STORYTIME TO THAT ALSO BUT STILL, ILL NEVER FORGET NOR FORGIVE HIM FOR THE THINGS HE CAUSED ME AS A CHILD) and no he did not actually rape me but i never said that i got raped by him.",0

"Here’s some things wrapping up my post. I couldn’t add that much to the post, so here it is.",0
"So I left this comment and a lot of people responded saying I should’ve added this to the post. I couldn’t add it on AITA, so here it is:",0
"“Omgggg where do I start. I moved in with her after her kid was born and her baby daddy left (I was only 15) and lived with her for three years and helped raise her kid, but she swears it never happened!! When she moved out of my parents she took the family dog with her. The last time she moved she asked for hell because she’s pregnant but then sat the entire time and did nothing. I had to clean hers and her sons room which both had trash up to my knees, and then pack EVERYTHING. Because her stomach hurt. Not to sound insensitive but the only time she seems to feel sick was when she had to do something. She was about 3 months along. My fiance (bf at the time) and I offered to help her move (like actually pack up the truck and move furniture and such) and AGAIN she sat doing NOTHING the entire time. It was -5 outside and she sat in the car. Once we were done, I got into the car and she said “oh good you’re done” and i was like “yeah. We’re done. You could’ve helped.” And she said “it’s cold” I- UGGGHHHH WAS SO MAD. But she was pregnant so I pushed through. I kept helping. After, my “bf” and I were talking about where we wanted to eat and she started screaming at us to stfu because she’s hungry and doesn’t want to listen to people talk about food. Omg I was mortified. He spent all day lugging furniture in negative weather and she was so rude!! Never even thanked him. Then, I was over the moon to throw her a baby shower, I love kids. But she never sent me an invite list. I waited months and eventually made it myself because we were running out of time and she PITCHED A FIT about who I did or didn’t invite. And then she fucking uninvited me. To a babyshower i spent hundreds of dollars and hours of time planning. The only jobs she has a the pregnant mother is to make an invite list and show up on time. But she also complained about the time I planned it!! Omg I couldn’t believe it.”",0
"FINAL UPDATE I sent out an email canceling the wedding “to avoid any conflicts with child care arrangements” and “we decided it wasn’t fair to people with children.” Obviously, this isn’t true, but that’s where this all began so. I didn’t tell anyone about the conflict between my sister and I, but she had already dragged half of my family into it, so they knew the situation. This is each persons reaction:",0
"My parents: they were disappointed, but understand. My sister has always been a nightmare and we have always given her anything she wants, if for nothing else, just to shut her up. They literally let her take the family dog just to keep her from throwing a tantrum. They’re glad that I shut her up as well as not just giving her what she wants.",0
"His parents: they were so sad. They were really excited to have this vacation, but they’re still happy for us and understand.",0
Younger siblings: are fucking crushed. I’m going to go on a weekend trip with them to make up for it. That seemed to cheer them up.,0
"Sister: My fucking sister, made a facebook post telling everyone what an arrogant cnt I am!! She texted me saying she never wants to see me again, but she also said that when I accidentally broke her favorite perfume. And again when told her son he couldn’t have my cat, yes, MY cat of two years, and she told her son in front me “maybe auntie will let you take the cat when we leave” and she put me in the awkward and upsetting position of telling my nephew and sister absolutely not. And again when I wouldn’t make her dozens of meals for her to freeze for after she gave birth. And again when I didn’t buy her a gift for her baby shower that she uninvited me to, that I PLANNED. She’ll get over it once she needs a babysitter again, like every time.",0
"Everyone else: honestly, that’s just too much to go into. Some people are butthurt they don’t get to attend the wedding and are calling me “petty and small” (I am, idc) but some are just annoyed because this is what my sister does. This is who she is.",0
"I decided idgaf if I’m TAH or not. It’s my wedding, my fiancé is happy with this decision, and we will do what we want. But honestly, the people calling me an asshole were usually assholes themselves (telling me I’ll get divorced, my family probably hates me and they should go NC with me either way, that I’m insufferable, that I hate kids, that I’m a bad aunt, that I should never have kids, that I’m entitled etc etc) and I don’t think I should cater to people like that lol. Thanks for helping me realize how ungrateful people are!!",0

AITA for telling my sister she doesn’t have to come to my wedding? REPOST,0
"POST WAS REMOVED, HERES A COPY OF ORIGINAL",0
"My sister has two children, an 8yo and a new born. Our wedding (1.5 years away) is supposed to be child free with the exception of siblings because my fiancé and I both have large age gaps between us and our siblings, he has a 3, 4, and 12 year old brother, and I have a teenage brother. I also have my sister and older brother. Obviously we want our siblings at our wedding, even if they’re kids and it breaks our child free rule.",0
"For our wedding, we’re renting out a huge Airbnb for a week (a literal mansion) where the wedding and reception will be and invited all immediate family to stay with us for the week as our first family vacation as an official family. I love my nephews, I really really do, but my fiancé and I wanted to plan a bunch of adult/ couples events like wine tasting, ebike tours, snorkeling etc. and I don’t want kids with me when we do it.",0
"The host was nice enough to match us with some babysitters that he frequently works with for events just like this, so the other kids (our younger siblings) will stay at the Airbnb with the babysitter, but our parents know they have to pay for the babysitter (my fiancé and I are paying for all of the adult events we have planned like the wine tasting and tours etc.) and they’re okay with it. We want them to pay for childcare simply because I don’t want to be responsible for anyones children for the entirety of the wedding and vacation afterwards. Financially or emotionally. There will be plenty of things for the kids to do at the Airbnb as well.",0
"My sister said it’s not fair that our siblings are invited but not my nephews, and I told her if I broke the child free rule for everyone I loved, there would be no child free rule. She told me that if I’m not allowing kids, I have to pay for childcare and find someone to stay with them for a week. I told her no. She said “I’m not paying for a babysitter” and I told her “then don’t come.”",0
"I was pissed she was trying to manipulate me into paying for child care when I’m literally offering her an all expense vacation, the only thing she has to pay for is c h i l d c a r e for her own children. I told if she was going to make my wedding about her, I don’t want her there. She then flipped out and called me every name she could think of so I yanked her invite all together and told her I’d send her pics of the wedding and vacation afterwards so she can see where her selfishness got her.",0
"My family is super close to each other and I LOVE my nephews so everyone was very surprised I made the wedding child free but after I yanked my sisters invite, people started to also decline the invite. My response has pretty much been “you aren’t punishing me the way you think you are, all you’re doing is saving me money but if you don’t come support me on my love day i expect me to go no contact.”",0
Now everyone is pissed. At me. I think this may have come off as a bit bridezilla but I don’t think I owe any of them anything honestly. It’s MY wedding. Am I being a selfish AH?,0
"Edit: I don’t think I made clear that my family is holding their attendance over my head, and are saying “if you don’t invited your sister and nephews, I won’t come either.” So I told them, don’t come, but I didn’t appreciate the way they were trying to manipulate my decision so I told them if they don’t come, I’m going nc.",0
Edit 2: I told her she could come for the wedding and not stay for the vacation but she wanted both. I only uninvited her after she said a bunch of nasty stuff to me. The exception to the child free rule is for immediate family only. There will be things for the kids to do at the Airbnb.,0
"And a lot of people are saying “wait till you have kids” but I would just not come to the wedding. I would chose my kids over the wedding. To me, it’s my love day, but I understand to everyone else it’s just a stupid wedding lol, and I’m okay with that. No one has to come that doesn’t want to, and I’m okay with tabt, it’s completely understandable, but people that are not coming out of spite of the situation, I take a problem with.",0
"UPDATE: after reading all of the comments telling me no one cares about our wedding, the vacation doesn’t sound like it’d be fun at all, I’m being controlling, I’m being a selfish and an entitled bridezilla, I clearly don’t value my family etc etc, my fiance and I have decided to cancel our wedding all together!!! We’ll have a small ceremony for us and our parents and then my husband and I will use the big beautiful mansion we rented out as our honeymoon!! We’ll message the Airbnb host tomorrow about moving the date up. We’re very excited!! I realized neither of us wanted to cater to anyone because the only people that matter when it comes to our marriage is us!! Fuck everyone else lol!",0
"To everyone saying that child free wedding are “egotistical”: no one cares about your kids lol. I love kids, I really do, but no one should have to cater to your kids needs except YOU!!",0
"Thank you all for making me realize how stupid family weddings are, we don’t need them present to have our happily ever after. We’d prefer to avoid the drama all together. That’s all!!",0
"Edit 3: LMAOOO STOP COMING AT ME FOR CALLING IT MY LOVE DAY!!! And to those who asked, yes I did get that phrase from Grey’s Anatomy. Stop roasting me though 🤣🤣 I’ll update with families reaction to wedding cancellations tomorrow",0
"Edit 4: omgggg i get it!! It’s not a “child free wedding” because siblings will be there!! How about this, “no children allowed except siblings”?? Is that better?? It’s all semantics that tbf don’t matter.",0
"One more edit to clear somethings up: Airbnnbs have a limit on how many people can sleep at the BNB. I did say my sis could bring my nephews down if she wanted to participate in an event and they could stay with the sitter at BNB, but the kiddos could not spend the night or attend wedding and reception. Sis said no, all or nothing.",0

With this study, I am investigating further into why this affects Asians disproportionately.   If you are 13-18 years old, suspect you may have ADHD or are diagnosed with it, and are Asian, please PM me with your email! please also refer this to somebody who may be interested. Thank you!",0

Some humans who label themselves atheist claim not to believe in god(s),0
So these humans claim not to believe in magical things while they play WoW and watch avatar and talk about chasing their dreams. Who are all the magical superhero movies being made for and by? Atheists! lol,0
They say we're evolved from monkey's and no different to animals while they get married and talk about love and celebrate valentine's day (they're experts on love apparently so much so they're now defining it for us because they're experts on everything if you believe them that is which I don't).,0
They talk about 'hoping' for things which isn't very scientific at all.,0
They're being rewarded with reddit karma for being good while they mock religions for doing the exact same thing.,0
"On top of all that, these humans who pretend to be different to everybody else do the same things as everybody else...they look the same...dress the same...eat the same things...play the same games....go to the same places...live in the same world...and believe in the same thing; death.",0
These two groups of humans are one in the same because they behave exactly the same and believe in the same thing and they're both watching superman wishing it was them.,0
Reddit is an atheist web site which rewards people with karma,0
You can't reason with somebody who doesn't want to be reasoned with,0

"I have, many times.",0
These talking shits contradict you even though they know what you're saying is true.,0

They repeat stats and figures which they know are made up.,0
They repeat themselves over and over again; they have a routine.,0
They change the subject.,0
They confuse the matter at hand.,0
They blabber.,0
They refer to human psychology.,0
Their power lies in invisible things.,0
They insult you in an indirect manner because they still want to talk to you.,0
They gang up on you because they're weaker than you.,0
They're fake ass bitches with dutch courage.,0
Some call themselves christians.,0
Some call themselves atheists.,0
Some call themselves redditors.,0
Some call themselves a friend.,0
They know they are safe to talk shit to you about you because they know you're non-violent otherwise they wouldn't do it.,0
"They're not human, because they don't act it.",0
So I call them talking shits. That's my name for them.,0
What's the solution to get away from these talking shits?,0
I'm not 100% sure but a solution will present itself because talking shits don't decide my fate no matter how much reddit karma they have or what other talking shits think of them.,0
An atheist & a non-atheist go to the cinema,0
It's the latest superhero movie which is full of gods including Thor.,0
"Halfway through the movie the atheist leans over to the non-atheist and points to the god Thor and says, ""Boy, I wish that was me!"" and the non-atheist replies, ""It can never be you because you don't believe in gods remember? Why are you even here anyway!? Shouldn't you be conducting a scientific experiment in a lab or barking at the moon like an animal instead of sitting here with me wishing you were Thor?!""",0
What would happen if you had two exes come back to you who both asked to marry you?,0

Atheist sign post,0
Imagine living in a world where any business can use the McDonald's sign,0
You're driving down the road and you see a McDonalds sign so you pull in expecting a tasty Quarter Pounder with cheese only to find an RV salesman waiting to sell you a badly built RV that costs a small fortune.,0
Now replace the McDonald's sign with the American flag. You expect the american embassy but it's actually Cody selling RV's for Winnebago.,0
It gets worse because the guy flying that flag copyrighted and trademarked everything he could get his hands on to stop other people using those things unless they give him their time and energy.,0

"Disclaimer, this post is a legitimate question NOT meant to be inflammatory or single out any specific group I honestly almost didn’t want to ask this question because I just have a strong feeling it’s gonna be met with bunch of lying and racist trolling instead of a mature discussion ……but let’s hope I’m wrong and give it a shot I tried to number these according to different instances to make it easier to read",0
2. Something that I have been noticing ESPECIALLY at gyms like Planet Fitness is that there are a lot of Women who seem to think I’m going to the gym specifically to look at their asses and stomachs instead of minding my own business and focusing on my workouts.,0
3. I am not solipsistic by any means and normally give people the benefit of the doubt and assume that it’s nothing personal. (I know people have a tendency to believe others are watching them when it’s all in their head) But this happens WAAAAAAAYYYY too much to be just a coincidence,0
"4. I have noticed that there are always SOME women in the gym who have this habit of covering their bodies specifically their ass and stomach when they see me. And for some reason, the women who do this are usually the women who fall into the “brown” category, ie Latinas, Indians, Arab etc And while I generally am attracted to women in that category, I do not check them out at the gym.",0
"5. Ironically I don’t notice too many Anglo white women doing this. And East Asian women typically are in their own world and don’t worry about me from what I’ve noticed. But for some reason I’ve noticed that ALOT of brown women IN MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE seem to think I’m evaluating their bodies AND IM NOT Like they immediately become aware of what they are wearing the moment they see me But the truth of the matter is, I understand how people think, and I go OUT OF MY WAY to not look at ANYONE. Men or Women. I literally get in and get out",0
"6. Now I am a VERY muscular dude, and I initially thought it was because I’m muscular But I’ve noticed that the same women who do it to me don’t do it to other muscular guys who are not black So I can only assume it is because I’m black But strangely enough, I don’t see those same women who do it to me doing it to black men with skinny bodies So I’m thinking it is because I am BOTH Black AND muscular But what is the correlation between muscular black men and being horn-dogs in the minds of these women?",0
"7. Like I even remember a time when I was doing a calf exercise while burying my face in my phone And I can see from my peripheral this woman CONSTANTLY TURNING AROUND TO LOOK AT ME I’m going out of my way to NOT look back and just mind my business. Then when she continued to do it, I EVENTUALLY caved in and looked back at her, then she starts covering her ass as if I’m staring at it, and when she did that it kind of became a self fulfilling prophecy for her because it immediately made me look at her ass because she brought attention to it, and I saw that it was flat, and NOT TO BE RUDE, but I wouldn’t be looking at that flat ass if she didn’t bring attention to it",0
"8. Which brings me to my NEXT point NO OFFENSE, but I’ve noticed it’s ALWAYS the women with FLAT asses who do this! Like women with PHAT asses NEVER do this around me(in my experience) and the funny thing is if I WERE to be in the gym staring at women I would 100% certainly be staring at the ones with phat asses, but they aren’t the ones who freak out when they see me believing I’m checking them out and they need to cover their bodies.",0
"9. Even walking TOWARDS some of these women Sometimes it’s inevitable that you will make eye contact with people or look in someone’s direction especially when y’all are walking towards eachother in the gym Just yesterday, some woman wearing a sports bra and a jacket walking towards me and a bunch of other guys/girls with me being somewhere in the middle of that crowd. She pretty much ignored the other people and looked directly at ME. And immediately when we make eye contact she closes her jacket covering her stomach and boobs as if I was checking her out (which I wasn’t)",0
"10. I seriously want to know why this happens because it’s getting kind of irritating, as I’m someone who PRIDES himself on not being nosy OR thirsty I’m not angry at them because at this point NOTHING surprises me with humans anymore, I’m just genuinely curious as to if I’m doing something to lead women into believing I’m thirsty",0
"11. Oh and ONE MORE THING When men ask questions about why women respond negatively to them I’ve noticed there is ALWAYS one person who dismisses their question and says “Well maybe you’re creepy looking” The thing is, I always show up to the gym well groomed, and (being modest here) have been described as handsome pretty much my whole life So I highly DOUBT it’s because I look “creepy” But I am aware of the fact that in our world being black comes before that,  and very well might nullify my “handsomeness” in the minds of some women, AND THATS OKAY. It is what it is, I just don’t like being ACCUSED of something I’m not doing.",0
"12. But who knows, the fact that I’m very muscular and wear tank tops to the gym could be a huge contributing factor in addition to my race But WHY? Please don’t say it’s all in my head, because it is NOT most of the time It happens very frequently and SOMETIMES could be a coincidence but many times it is NOT.",0

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is racist,0
"Teacher tells child, ""What you're watching is racist. Shame on you!"".",0
"Child replies, ""Erm, excuse me but who are you and what does racist mean?""",0
"Teacher says, ""I'm a certified teacher that's who I am. Racist means hateful towards a particular kind of people. If you watch something racist,like you're doing right now, then you become racist too just like if you play violent video games you become violent"".",0
"Child replies, ""Oh, I didn't know any of this. I certainly don't want to be racist or violent! It never even crossed my mind I was doing something wrong by watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I'm so sorry if I offended you.""",0
"Teacher says, ""It's okay I forgive you because you don't know any different. I'll teach you how not to be racist; that will be my gift to you. You see those Ooompa Loompas? They mock black people so black people are highly offended by them and rightly so and because of that you should be offended too. But instead of being offended by them you're actually enjoying the racism. How do you think that makes the poor black people they mock feel about themselves?"".",0
"Child replies, ""What's a black people?",0
"Teacher says, ""A black person is a highly evolved human being with dark skin which your racist great great great great grandaddy stole from a hot sunny place called Africa to do free work for him in his back yard"".",0
"Child, ""My grandad stole highly evolved people to sweep up for him?""",0
"Teacher, ""Yes, he was a weak evil racist but don't worry there is still hope for you yet as long as you do as I say. Listen to me and you will learn to love and respect these amazing brave black people in the same way I do.""",0
"Child says, ""But Oompa Loompas are short and orange with green hair? I thought they were make believe. Aren't you the one insulting black people by saying Oompa Loompas resemble them and that they can't defend themselves?""",0
"Teacher says, ""Spoken like a true racist. Look, you just can't see it like I can but the racism is cleverly hidden so you become racist towards black people without even knowing it. Now turn that off and repeat after me, 'I will not be racist towards black people'"".",0
"Child says, ""I will not be racist towards black people"".",0
"Teacher says, ""Good, later on I will explain why you are homophobic and how you can fix that too. But for now I want you to go and throw out all your favourite books so we can make black people happy after your family treated them so badly. It's only fair don't you think? You're going to really love black people by the time I've finished with you and you will be a better human being because of it."".",0

Different Statuses on Different Servers in Discord,0
Does anyone know how to make it so you look like you're offline on one server and online on another? My cousin forced me to join her server and I want to make it look like I barely use discord so she stops bothering me. I can't just leave cause she'll probably get upset and I can't just stay offline the entire time cause I like being disturbed by people who don't constantly talk about fnf ☞︎(-__-)☜︎,0

Some trollish statements I've personally heard (with pics),0
What every celebrity has that I don't,0
Love VS illuminati love,0
Having multiple wives is sinful,0
"It's bad to christians even though their hero is King Solomon who had 700 wives and 300 mistresses. Their other hero, Jesus, has 0 women.",0
It's bad to atheists too even if the women are the ones who suggest it and you care about them and they say you deserve it. Christians call it sinful while Atheists bring in mental issues and lack of education and things like that (atheists don't believe in people being meant for one another or anything like that),0
"You can cheat on as many women as you want though, that's okay, and so is abandoning as many women as you want (they call this divorce).",0
Rejecting women completely (homosexuality) is celebrated.,0
Counterfeiting a woman (trangenderism) is fine too (just don't counterfeit their shit because they will sue you for it!).,0
Paying females to punch each other in the face is cool.,0
A woman desecrating herself with low quality permanent tattoos? A OK.,0
A woman destroying a female baby? Lovely.,0
A woman taking her clothes off in public and having sex with as many people as possible? Brilliant idea (especially if you film it and share with everybody!).,0
If you want to be a celebrity on CNN and Wikipedia then just murder lots of women; they will love you for it.,0
"But I better not dare think about having more than 1 wife ESPECIALLY if they are pretty. That's bad, man, and so is smoking cannabis! They will scowl and pull a face and call me sick or a wishful thinker if I suggest such a thing.",0
"Ironically, one of their favourite slogans is 'Do you dare'?",0
"Last but not least; a virgin woman waiting for Mr. Right? She's an evil, stupid, naive, gullible, weak, oppressed, brain damaged woman. When Mr. Right comes along she has to be well used and broken beyond repair otherwise she is worthless! /s",0
This is why Wikipedia is a troll web site,0
Demi Lovato (another troll) wants to be called 'they' instead of 'she' and the trolls of Wikipedia gladly oblige (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi_Lovato). The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints wants to be known as The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints not LSD or Mormon but the trolls of Wikipedia continue to use LSD and Mormon labels (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints).,0
Every Wikipedia page about a US city or county begins with a sob story blamed on 'white european settlers'.,0
Wikipedia people pages have 'sexuality' sections where their sexual preferences (natural vs unnatural) are called into question even if they are 'dead' and can't defend themselves.,0
"Wikipedia trolls know the history of everything, like Rick from Pawn Stars, as though they were actually there.",0
"Wikipedia trolls are experts on women, what makes women happy, and relationships. They know more about your wife than you.",0
Wikipedia claims humans are no different to animals while promoting LGBTQQ.,0
They say anybody can edit Wikipedia but if you do and the trolls don't like it then it gets reverted (sometimes automatically) and you get labelled a vandal (it doesn't take much to upset the trolls!).,0
"Wikipedia sources are unnofficial out-of-date web sites and books, rumour, gossip, fake news, hearsay, etc. The only proof Wikipedia has is a URL to another troll web site.",0
Wikipedia trolls don't take into account somebody they refer to could be lying about themselves or somebody else.,0
"Wikipedia promotes elitism and favouritism because you're not considered a 'notable person' if you're not on Wikipedia. On Wikipedia, child rapists and murderers are more important than you.",0
Wikipedia trolls present themselves as scientific and objective while making references to 'dumb blondes' without providing any scientific evidence hair colour determines intelligence(because there isn't any).,0
Wikipedia says that on the one hand a man with multiple wives is very bad for the women (who it calls undeucated) and on the other hand a woman with a wife is natural and good for the women (lol).,0
"On Wikipedia, 'black people' are perpetual rape victims and 'white people' are perpetual rapists of black people.",0
"On Wikipedia, 'jewish people' are perpetual rape victims and white people are perpetual rapists of jewish people.",0
"On Wikipedia, 'american indians' are perpetual rape victims and white people are perpetual rapists of american indians.",0
"On Wikipedia, women are perpetual rape victims and men are perpetual rapists of women.",0
"Wikipedia lists unnofficial and stupid national and international holiday days aswell as religious holidays. International Man Day is on International Toilet day. Gee, what a surprise.",0
"Wikipedia claims the human race is evolved from an ape, rapes children and is queer.",0
Wikipedia calls itself scientific yet most of the subject matter is subjective tripe (just like CNN and the Guardian).,0
Wikipedia has a reference to LGBTQQ (unnatural love) inserted into almost all pages in one way or another as though it's a normal part of life when it isn't.,0
"On Wikipedia, everybody has been sexually assaulted and prefers the same sex to the opposite sex.",0
Wikipedia trolls can't seem to tell the difference between a woman and a man but they can tell the difference between male and female clothing.,0
Wikipedia repeats government stats and polls which can't be personally verified.,0
Wikipedia is headquartered in San Francisco where two other trolls reside; Twitter and Reddit.,0
Wikipedia is a know-it-all in  world full of confusion and chaos.,0
Wikipedia claims 'trophy wives' are evil. Trophy wife being another non-scientific Wikipedia creation like the dumb blonde.,0
Wikipedia preaches like a religion.,0
Wikipedia is funded by begging like a religion.,0
Wikipedia plays both sides to purposefully boost one side; the fake side.,0
Wikipedia mixes fact with fiction so you think fiction is fact and fact is fiction.,0
Wikipedia is slanderous.,0
When a woman does it first then it's a female  accomplishment but when a man does it first it's a human accomplishment.,0
Wikipedia speaks over you and for you without your permission and doesn't let you respond.,0
My wife of a year and half (soon to be ex wife)cries every time I bring up an issue.,0
"First of all, we are already going through divorce so this is all sort of irrelevant to an extent. But I need to know for future information. Anytime we get in the car (I’m a very chill person) she finds a way to get me so frustrated and upset. Whether it is something she said, did, or how she said it (usually all three) and when I tell her  “It just really hurts me when you do X and it makes me really upset”. I usually say this with a tone that’s serious but I’m not yelling but I’, like I said, upset. She then proceeds to tell me to stop yelling at her, take a breath, she wants to hear me take a breath, then talk to her in a calm tone of voice. I then repeat what I said slower and softer, she then gets mad and says “I CANT HEAR YOU”, I then get frustrated but repeat what I said as calmly as I can. She then gets mad that I’m talking too slowly and to “get to the point”. At this point I tell her “Look you did X and it’s upsetting me.” Then she gets starts to yell and tell me I’m yelling and being mean and starts to cry. I have gotten to where I almost feel nothing when she cries because THIS is how we get to the crying. I’m just upset now and she proceeds to tell me what an asshole I am because I’m not coddling her. It feels manipulative and I feel like a dick for not responding in a positive soft way when she is crying… am I an asshole? Is she manipulative? What does this look like?",0

"Hey guys. I am a childhood abuse survivor and a survivor of domestic violence. I am currently researching the long-term consequences of childhood abuse and intimate partner violence. There are many consequences I feel, or have experienced, but do not see researched at all in the academic community. I would like to research these connections and consequences to discover if they are commonly shared amongst survivors and hopefully bring awareness to all of the effects of this trauma. I have created an anonymous survey that I graciously invite any survivor of child abuse (including emotional abuse) or a survivor of domestic violence from a romantic partner to fill out, if they would like to help my research and raise awareness. In exchange, if anyone would like to receive the results of the study down the line, message or email me and I will happily send them to you upon conclusion of my research.

I've got better things to do,0
I keep hearing about the 'seperation of church and state' but the church is a business so it should be the 'seperation of business and state',0
The state should not be in bed with business because business is a selfish greedy parasitic thief therefore it is against the people and the state is meant to be for the people.,0
The state could setup a non-profit company whch produces everything so the people aren't held hostage by selfish greedy parasitic thieves.,0
An alternative option to selfish greedy parasitic thieves is vital if freedom is your  true goal otherwise you're just a blood sucking tick in sheep's clothing.,0

How does one become 'openly gay'?,0
Why anybody would want to be such a thing is beyond me.,0
Do you go out of your way to tell strangers in the street you're 'gay'? Do you wear a certain type of tshirt that states you're gay? Do you have to wear your hair in a certain kind of way? Do you have to walk a certain kind of way?,0
Can you be openly white and openly male or just openly gay?,0
"Also, how do you prove to people you're actually gay and happy to be gay?",0
I need to know these things so I can be openly 'not gay' but I'm not sure I need to really because nobody has ever questioned me on the topic in all the years I've been alive. I have been asked if I like to pay with cash or credit but I've never been asked if I like boys or girls and I've never felt the urge to tell people I lke girls.,0

"Adolf Hitler (supreme ruler, undemocratic, owned a GSD, took pest control to a whole new level, showed 'em who's boss, took no shit from anybody, created Herbie and classic WW2 movies which I used to watch every Christmas after a turkey dinner)",0
King Solomon (had thousands of girls falling at his feet and a mine full of gold. King of the real Israel not a half baked UN version. He also had a pet monkey just like MJ).,0
"Henry VIII (supreme ruler, undemocratic, threw out the roman catholic church from his backyard, took no shit from anyone, King of the greatest nation on earth and greatest union on earth. He would definatley be a Brexiteer. He devised a guaranteed way of never accidentally bumping into one of his unruly disobedient ex-girlfriends or one of her new lovers)",0
Superman (the greatest comic superhero of all time and his mates are awesome too),0
Wonder Woman with big tits,0

Jacques De Molay (founded the Knights Templars),0
"Jesus Christ (god, immortal, spaceman, the only begotten, one of a kind, sacrificed himself for others, regenerated himself, changed his appearance, used numerology, likes to keep priceless things close and useless things distant. As god he created pepperoni pizza, cannabis and pussy, and as Jesus he turns water into wine so he's fab at parties)",0

Why 29 you may ask?,0
"Well, my 5 previous love interests were aged 16, 19, 21, 31, and 39 so 29 is missing and  that drives me crazy because it looks untidy and incomplete. I also need a friend to talk to (a little bird told me it's nice to have a friend) because I feel like I'm on a deserted island gone stir crazy.",0

"I process verbs differently than newspaper headlines portray. The problem is headlines and spacing, where my brain is looking for the subject-verb, which headlines often omit to make headline font sizes bigger. This practice is obsolete, as most news isn't limited by physical newspaper size anymore, but the practice remains in journalism, and I don't know why.In my brain '3 shot at waffle house' and '3 WERE shot at waffle house' are two very different stories.",0

Your Cells Probably Wouldn't Think You Exist Either,0
"If your cells could understand and were offered up the idea that you were the Lord of your body and the the microverse within, it would probably call bullshit.",0
"What proof is there of this being, of John Doe's existence? Who or what is this invisible John Doe ghost that lords over it. It is said that john Doe is a conscious entity has power over the body but then where us is this John Doe? Why does he not show himself? It is not the will or might of John Doe it is through the co-operation and work performed by this grand organization of cells, governed by the brain and central nervous system, another organization of cells performing computations to determine and manage day to day operations. After all, when men form organizations and governments does the government spawn a consciousness, does your local Walmart have a consciousness just because a clump of live men operate it? Is an ant colony in itself also a singular living being that actually gains a singular consciousness apart from the individual awareness of the ants?",0
"That John Doe is All, and body as a wholey spiritual being is ridiculous, wheres the proof that it truly experiences this weird unified consciousness, it simply acts in like a colony does. The ant colony is not a being called Anthony, it is an ant colony, and there is no human being called John Doe, its is a cell colony.",0

Piss Warlock and Sorcerer Asshat,0
"The warlock pissed against the wind and covered his robe in phosphorus, and so he walked back to his abode through a bendy-mountain trail and through wrought-iron gates, through a courtyard where glowing blue flowers grew and up a staircase that spiraled around a massive crystal.",0
"When he stood in his room again, he looked around and saw himself reflected in the mirrors that covered all the walls. He sighed and the many other versions of him sighed as well, except for one that pointed and laughed at the dripping piss-stained robe he wore. In his anger, the warlock threw a ball of pestilence that shattered the glass, and in doing so he killed the part of himself that found any of it humorous.",0
"Cursing himself, the warlock pondered the orb in the center of his room carefully. In the magic ball, swirled images of angels and demons, of fire and water. He thought, thoughtfully. When nothing came to mind he cursed himself again, and the visage of fire grew upon the orbs clear-blue surface.",0
"The warlock turned his back and stared out the window, at a land covered in soot and rumbling with bubbles of tar. Behind him, unbeknownst to him, a sorcerer was staring at him, using his orb as a magic mirror, a medieval hacker of sorts, the reason you should tape up your webcam. So the warlock pondered the land, and the sorcerer pondered him.",0
"Where the sorcerer was from, was a land of plenty. He grew mushrooms whose spores were gold dust, and he sat fat, and happy for most of his life, except... he wasn't happy, he was bored to death. He had seen dragons, he talked to fairies, he was visited by angels and his servants  brought him everything he asked for. He never thought to ask where they got it from though, they could bring him anything - they brought to him the essence of life, rare woods and magical water that when you drank it, made you younger.",0
"The warlock starred further, at stumps and dried up ponds. He cursed again. He cursed some more.",0
"The sorcerer watched, and as he watched the warlock grew darker, grew larger, and breathed a gout of fire in pure rage and anguish - the sorcerer gulped, in his golden palace in the clouds, and pondered what to do about this rising anger, how to squash it before it threatened his prosperity.",0
"While the warlock cried, and fought, and seethed with all his might, wracking his brain for why, WHY, oh why — has his land been compromised, who was stealing the milk and honey, who had drained his lakes, who was responsible for his thirst. In his fury, he summoned three furies, and they whispered in his ear of an evil sorcerer.",0
"Meanwhile, back in the clouds, in fear that he might be uncovered, the blue-robed Sorcerer called upon three fairies, and they whispered to him that he should hide, cover his palace in an illusion, and beg the warlock for his forgiveness if he ever should uncover it.",0
"For if he didn’t, the fairies saw with their future-sight, that the warlock would find him, and he would bring his flying castle crashing to the ground, his clouds would be evaporated, his gold would be turned to lead, and the warlock would drench him in piss.",0

Finally found the perfect group to share this thought.,0
Ok so I’m not engaged yet but me and my bf both agree that we are going to get married. I had some ideas for my future wedding that are very sentimental to me that I’d like to share.,0
"First, my grandma on my dads side died years ago and she was in love with Elvis. I already planned on playing can’t help falling in love at my wedding but I just think it would be perfect if it was the original Elvis version to honor her.",0
"Second, it’s not something I’ve ever heard of anyone doing but I want to have basically a “second dance” for my mom and dad after me and my mans first dance because they haven’t had something super special about them since their renewal of their vows when I was in 3rd grade and I’m almost 20. They deserve it and frankly need it.",0
"Third, I’m not sure if everyone does this but in my family we have the matriarchs of the family walk down the aisle to their seats with their husbands before the bridal party walks down. My mom always sang you are my sunshine to me  my entire life, and I’d like her to walk down to an instrumental version of it.",0
"Fourth, the true matriarch of my moms side of the family (my great grandma) passed away just a couple years ago and I’d also like to play a song to honor her that’s hopefully also a sentimental song to my immediate grandma:)",0

"[WP] Scientists invent a medicine that you can take before reaching puberty to become ""immortal"" (stop ageing at around 30y old), but whoever takes it cannot have children.",0
(This was deleted from r/writingprompts) while having 5 upvotes already. I put it here so that it doesn't get lost in the cancelling machine.),0
"Suppose that in some near future (think 10/20 years from now), scientists find a ""cure"" for ageing. Whoever takes the cure, keeps growing until ""maturity"" (around 30 years old maybe), and then their cells stop the ""growing"" phase but keep replacing with new cells without decay (stops ""getting old"").",0
"The twist is... this medicine has to be taken once before people reach puberty (hence, pepole who decide to take it will never have children), and thus individuals/society/??? have to decide at quite a young age wheter to take it or not.",0
"At a quick glance we may think that everybody would take it... but this would bring the end of humanity: As people can still die in accidents.  So, maybe at a certain point in the more distant future, people who decide not to take it (and thus, decide to age/die of ""natural"" causes) may become more ""valuable"" for society, as they keep society growing.",0

Motivation tips ??,0
"To quickly summarise I have no motivation whatsoever which is terrible because I have my A levels in a few months but I can’t focus or bring myself to study. I have a test tomorrow which I haven’t started revising for and I can feel the anxiety building up in me yet I’m still here on my phone -my biggest distraction. I honestly hate being on my phone,hate social media but I seem to be on it 24/7. I do want to do well and go to university. I am smart and I know I have the potential to do very well which is the worst part as I know I’m wasting it. I always leave things to the last minute and procrastination is what I do best. I also hate doing badly in tests and getting things wrong so not sure why I can’t bring myself study. A big part of revising chemistry specifically is the stress and anxiety I get when I come across a question I can’t do so I end up taking a break and not returning to the work because I get such a bad headache from the stress/anxiety.",0

Thick or slim girls?,0
"I for one hate the comparison of different body types and I believe that all healthy bodies are beautiful. However, there's a lingering question about the preference of body types that's been bugging me: do guys prefer thick girls or slim girls. myself(17F) am slim and not curvy at all and I've been called flat a few times which has really degraded my confidence. I know that not having an ass or boobs isn't the end of the world (some guys make it feel like it is 😅 )but it's not exactly a pleasant feeling being body shamed. Majority of the guys I know all prefer thick, curvy women and the fact that im not that body types makes me feel as if im not good enough to live up to a guys standards ( sounds ridiculous, I know). Anyway because of those standards I was really insecure about being skinny and I tried putting on weight which I managed to do but I ended up hating the way I looked and realised I was doing it for all the wrong reasons. I've actually realised I like being slim and I like my small boobs (still wish I had an ass though) but I was only trying to live up to those standards and now I feel as if I've ruined my body. I also developed hip dips after gaining weight fast and losing it fast which I never had before, I actually had very nice hips before which was the one thing I liked about my body. Now I hate my body more than ever and have pretty bad body dysmorphia. I know it should never be a this or that body type as both are beautiful but I've just always felt so insecure about not being thick or curvy.",0

Why Does Suicide Make You ‘Crazy’?,0
Random question:,0
"Why are you crazy if you commit suicide or are suicidal (excluding religious reasons)? There are atheists living on this planet who believe that you feel nothing after death, an abstract idea that our minds cannot comprehend, ‘how can a blind person see nothing?’, it’s impossible to imagine. So if they believe that you feel nothing when you die, no after life, why can’t you just die when and how you want?",0
"There’s debate about how you may ‘miss’ something in the future if you kill yourself, but you won’t and that’s the argument - You just feel nothing. You don’t have access to regrets or wants when you are lifeless and non existent in any world. Similarly, it doesn’t matter how depressing or exciting your life is in this world since it’s temporary and you won’t remember any of it when you are non existent. Death is inevitable and the only thing every human has in common and thus, we use abstract hobbies and thoughts to pass the time to get closer to death. But let’s say you’re bored of life and want to just not exist, why is that bizarre?",0
