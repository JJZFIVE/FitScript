Yes.,1

"You have three bicep exercises that all emphasize the biceps muscles, so I'd replace preacher curls with hammer curls to have one that will bias your brachialis",1
very similar to mine lol,1
"Does anyone know a good protein shake that isnt made out of milk (gives me acne), anything nut related (soy etc), or peas? Im alleric to all of those things :'(((((",1
How is soy nut related? It’s a bean/legume. I have a tree nut allergy and consume plenty of soy.,1
"Maybe revisit the soy question. I thought I was allergic to almond and coconut for a long time, but learned I wasn’t by experimentation and eat tons of both now!",1

Any good online communities where I can find a good fitness coach? I want to physically prep for high level sports this year.,1
So here i am. 25yo dude 5'8 240lbs TRYING to get under 200lbs and i dont know anything really about meal prep since i am not a fan a all about veggies (childish iant it 🤣) and i have no idea what to cook. I started a new job last month and lost 20lbs juat from moving around and stuff so i know that if i commit to a better lifestyle i can achieve my goal.,1
So i wanted to ask if anyone got some meal prep idea and if any of the home workout apps are actually any good .,1
Thanks a lot,1
"I use fitbod and I love it. It lets you choose from so many different exercises and there’s lots of options even if you don’t have much equipment. It’s very customizable too. It will plan your workouts for you based on your fitness goals, fitness experience, and which muscles you used last time.",1
Tons of meal prep subreddits! Also lookup the bodyweight routine from the fitness wiki.,1
Hey. First time posting here. Been working our for 3-ish years consistently. Recently pulled a chest muscle for the first time. About a week ago. I wanted to ask if applying ice to the mid-chest region will cause any sort of disease like pneumonia or something. Its winter nowadays and my friends have told me of developing something like that in case of applying ice to that region,1
"No, ice will 100% not give you pneumonia, don't worry about that at all.",1
"Dumb question: am i supposed to ""feel"" my upper back after back day. I can feel my LATs get pumped but my upper back frustrates me cause i dont know whether im doing something wrong",1
"Unless you can curl as much as you row, you're engaging your upper back. Feeling it isn't a requirement.",1
I’m currently in my bulk after my first cut. Should I still be doing ab workouts? I feel so silly asking this but any help would be appreciated!!,1
"I'd recommend it if your goal is strength (leg raises, ab wheel, cable crunches). If your goal is bodybuilding, then it doesn't matter.",1
"Some people don’t do direct ab work and rely on compound movements, others incorporate Abs isolation",1
Yes,1
My arms don’t seem to be growing sideways.,1
"I’ve been going on an off the gym for the past year (due to schedule conflict, not by choice), and I notice that my arms are getting bigger but only from the side. Once you look at my arms from the front, it looks thin compared to from the side. Am I doing something wrong? Or is there a specific way to address this?",1
Don't neglect shoulder work. It gives you the wide look for overall physique. Here is the great Eric Bugenhagen talking about that effect.,1
Am I doing something wrong?,1
"You've given literally zero information about what you're actually doing, so there's no way for anybody to know if you're doing something wrong",1
"Train your brachialis mores, helps with the width. Hammer and rope cable curls are your friend",1
"It takes a lot of mass to make your arms noticeably wider, so couple that with only having been going to the gym for a year and not being consistent, that's why.",1
Am I doing something wrong if I don’t feel like I’m starving when cutting?,1
"I’m starting out pretty hard at 1800kcal, which I feared would result in me being hungry all the time, or just falling back and binge eating. But till now, I’ve managed to stay full all throughout the day, while eating pretty good.",1
"Am I doing something wrong and maybe just tracking way off, or is it to be expected?",1
If your average weight is going down over the weeks then no,1
"It's a bit bro sciencey (i.e. I can't point to any specific studies, this is just anecdotal) but it almost feels like once your body gets used to not eating too much your stomach shrinks, hunger hormones reduce and you kind of just coast along a bit.  On the shrinking front , on NY day I went to an all you can eat breakfast buffet and didn't eat anywhere near as much as I would have / could have in years past.",1
"Also bear in mind that your ""cut"" calories may end up being, or very close to, your eventual final diet (i.e. an 80kg person should eat/need fewer calories than a 120kg person). So, ideally you shouldn't really be hungry as it's your final diet.",1
,1
As long as you are losing weight in line with your plan you should be fine.,1
Hunger is just a signal your body sends to your brain. If it’s not happening and you’re losing weight count yourself lucky.,1
If you’re not losing weight you’re not cutting like you think and calories aren’t actually that low.,1
"If you’re losing weight as your desired pace, then you aren’t doing anything wrong",1
"First time going to the gym. Am I really this weak, or is this normal?",1
"Went to the gym for the first time today. Started running a few months ago and am now able to run a 10k in under an hour. I wanted to start strength training to put some muscle on my noodle arms, but I couldn't even finish this basic routine I set up:",1

"Instead, I did this:",1
"Flat bench press 90 lbs: 1x10, 1x9, 1x5 Incline dumbell press. 50 lbs: 2x4; 40 lbs: 1x4 Tricep cable extension. 30 lbs: 2x4. Seated DB shoulder press. Not done",1
"Feeling really demotivated with this. Should I just start with lighter weights or decrease the reps to 3x5? For reference: 25M, 150 lbs, skinny fat",1
"Don't feel bad about it, it's normal for your sets to decrease if you do an exercise to complete failure, and also as a beginner. Keep at it and you'll make tons of progress in the next 6 months.",1
"In case nobody else mentioned, I'd suggest you discard the routine you set up and pick one of the beginner routines from the wiki here. They're well thought out, heavily vetted and proven to be effective, and they also account for things that a beginner wouldn't plan for, such as how and when to add or remove weight.",1
Good luck.,1
Start with what you can handle. Maybe it doesn’t seem like much but it’ll get you started,1
"It's normal to not hit your numbers if you're not strong enough to hit them yet. That's why I'm not deadlifting 500kg.

"If it’s your first time going to the gym and you don’t really have any form of lifting in your life you’ll be weak. Just keep going. Drop weights until you can do them, sets of 5 and sets of 8-12 are both fine but work for different purposes.",1
"It’s your first time in the gym, you’re fine. Go for a slightly smaller rep range, 3x8 is fine, that’s still in the zone for hypertrophy.

If you stick with it you’ll make a ton of progress the newby gains are real",1
"Hey guys, I’m a 23 year old male and am 5”11, 230 pounds with a 35 inch waist. According to my Drs BMI scale I am obese… but I got Body fat tested and it’s only 14%. Is that a lot? Would you try to lose more weight? I was 265 in July and have dropped to 229-230 now.",1
"I can't wrap my head around how you knew enough to get your body fat tested, but have no clue what the result means.",1
"Hard to tell without seeing you, however - you mention your doctors BMI scale, which tells me that a medical professional looked at you and made a point to check your BMI/weight, so, if it/he/she/they says you are obese chances are that you are and should drop more weight.",1
Or an easier more accurate measure would be to get your blood pressure measured and see what it says. That would be another pointer that you need to drop weight.,1
,1
"Edit: Hold on - you saw a doctor. If they told you to lose weight, why are you asking the internet?",1
"It’s hard to say without seeing your body composition, but how did you test your BF? If you used something with sensors you just hold on your hands then odds are it’s wildly inaccurate.",1
Bodyfat scales are inaccurate to the point of being useless. 230lbs@5'11 is definitely obese territory.,1
Unless you are absolutely ripped you almost certainly need to lose another 30lbs.,1
"Let's say I do 2x chest and 2x back one day. Is it better to do chest, then back, then chest, then back or do chest, chest, back, back?",1
Whatever feels better. I would be concerned with recovery doing back to back days with the same body parts though.,1
"I would alternate, but you could do either one.",1
The answer to these questions is always almost depends and what ever your preference is,1
"Personally I like to do compound chest, compound back, chest accessory, back accessory",1
That's just a personal preference though,1
What to expect after getting back to the gym after 3 months of doing nothing?,1
"I started lifting and kept doing it consistently for 3 months and for another 3 months, aka until recently, I was on bed rest (separate issue) and then I was only able to, like, go on walks.",1
"I've made a fair amount of progress during those 3 months of lifting. My body changed drastically (I had only lost 3kg, but my measurements dropped and my cellulite was gone) and I was able to lift more with each session. When I stopped, I continued eating the same and while I only gained 1 kg, my body went back to square one (measurements increased, cellulite is back).",1
So what's going to happen now? Can I make the same progress in the same time span? I only know I can't jump straight into the weights I used to be able to lift and I should cut back a bit.,1
3 months is incredibly short term for anything fitness related. You’ve probably lost strength and some body composition but it’ll come back quickly. Just stick to your program.,1
You’ll be weaker but not where you started. Just drop the weights to ease into it.,1
It’ll probably be faster to progress the second time versus the first,1
Is it important that i will rest the standard rest time of 45 seconds between different excercises? Is it important if its on the same muscle group?,1
"45 seconds is not the standard rest time, and you should rest as long as you need to complete the prescribed work.",1
"Hiya new here, I'm a dude weighing 54.4 kilos with a BMI of 20.5 yet I'm skinny fat with skinny-ish arms, and a bulging tummy. I'm also 163cm tall.",1
"My waist measurements are 29 inches, neck about 13 inches.",1
I do strength training 4-5 times a week & consume less than 1200 calories a day. On my workout days I have my protein shake. There is no junk food in my diet.,1
"Any idea how do I get rid of my skinny fat tummy? If I lose weight, I'll go under the recommended BMI. But if I gain weight, I might gain fatty weight too. What do I do? Do I maintain my weight and continue my strength training to get rid of my tummy? Do I gain weight by consuming more calories to get stronger and bigger muscles? I'm confused.",1

Thinking about trying to attempt powerlifting but I’m not sure what the next step is after being on PPL for 2ish years. Any tips or programs?,1
"PPL isn't a program, it's a split. Doesn't give any indication what you did.",1
Pick a program like 5/3/1 or GZCLP and start lifting heavy.,1
r/powerlifting has programme recommendations and info in their side bar about feds/competing/etc,1
look at the wiki in the thread to find a powerlifting program,1
"I am preparing for my first half marathon. It’s a 12 week program. I go for strength training twice a week. It’s a full body program. I started to think that maybe I need to build more strength on my lower body and have 2 splits in my resistance training. That means 4 days of running and 4 days of strength trainings per week. Is that any good? I plan to put my leg days before or after the runs. Would that be a viable solution? Or I shall not consider 2 splits right now until the half marathon is over? Please help me in deciding as I have not much knowledge about muscles and their impact on trainings. Btw, I started strength training 3 months ago.",1
More strength is always nice in general but would it help with a purely endurance sport like marathon running?,1
"The general consensus in the community for questions like this is to try it and see if you like it, then adjust.",1
If you do 4x strength sessions per week and feel like you’re not recovering well then just drop it back to 2,1
"You can strength train 2 or 4 days a week, whatever you want to do.  If you want to be stronger 4 days may be better than 2.",1
More strength training at this point is not going to help out your running or half marathon training so i wouldn't do extra days lifting if that's what you're hoping to get from it,1
"Bmi calculator says im mildy obese, but body fat calculator says i have 15% body fat. Im i just big boned/wide frame? Im 6' 0"" 220 lbs size 38 waist. To be honest i think i look pretty chubby especially around the waist. I assumed my body fat would be around 25%. Maybe its just inaccurate?",1
"Ignore the body fat %, they're super inaccurate. I had a scale label me as 14%... As a woman who still had a little bit of belly pudge, that's basically impossible and would be super unhealthy for me!",1
"Usually, if you're asking this question, you're fat and got weight to lose. The people who get to ignore BMI have been training for years and have a lot of muscle built up. (My buddy, for example, 6'2, 230lbs, but rock solid muscle everywhere. Technically BMI chart he's overweight, but it's not cus of fat!)",1
"Lol, have you ever seen a fat / big boned skeleton?",1
"Unless you're jacked you are not likely 15% body fat at that height/weight.  If you want to calculate more accurately you can go pay for a dexa scan. But like the other poster said, if you look at a picture and don't like how fast you look, then just lose more fat. Who cares about the percent",1
Body fat calculators are notoriously inaccurate.,1
Does putting your legs behind you when doing pullups (because the bar is too low) make it easier vs straight legs?,1
Did pullups at the gym vs at home today and it just felt harder.,1
"If not, how much do you think the bar thickness matters? The one at home is thicker and softer.",1
"Mossy people find smaller bars better for pulling movements,  larger bars for pushing movements.  Whether legs are straight or crossed can change your center of gravity so you might find one way easier than the other.",1
Personally when the bar is thinner I can do so many more reps than if the bar is really thick or even worse when its padded. Being tall I usually put my legs behind me but if the bar is high enough to where i can keep them straight it feels a little easier with them straight under me,1
on a ppl routine what day do you add a hip thrust exercise to?,1
Legs.,1
"Quick question. If I invest in a bench that inclines, and a set of dumbbells, am I missing anything for a simple daily push/pull type routine? I can jog around my neighborhood for cardio, I just know I don’t want to drive all the way to the closest gym after a 12 hour shift.",1
A bench with adjustable dumbbells is some of the most cost efficient + flexible things you can buy for personal use. You can get very strong and in shape with just those.,1
"Only problem is it becomes really easy to max out weights on dumbbells. I bought 75 lb dumbbells and was able to hit that ceiling in squats, deadlifts, bench press, and rows. Only lasted me half a year before I had to change things up",1
The only additional thing you need for the r/fitness wiki dumbbell PPL routine is a pullup bar.,1
https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/,1
"Id say you can work just about every muscle with that set up. but be wise with your dumbbell selection or get a set so you have multiple weight options. If you need a list of exercises you can do for each upper body muscle with only a bench, let me know",1
how late night can a late night workout be,1
The only answer to this is subjective. As late as you want.,1
I think if you get past 4am it becomes a morning workout,1
"I don't work out after around 8 or 9pm as it messes with my sleep too much. Your milage may vary, evening work outs don't bother some people at all.",1
As late as you want if you have a flexible bed time,1
"16M 6’1 88kg, want to cut to 83kg but worried that a caloric deficit will stunt my growth? Is that true? will a small deficit of 500cals stunt my growth?",1
Is that true? will a small deficit of 500cals stunt my growth?,1
No. It takes malnourishment to stunt growth.,1
"What do you mean by stunt your growth? Your muscles might get less gains overall, but if you want to cut you must be in a deficit.",1
Just make sure you're still getting lots of protein.,1
"18M, 5'6, 114 lbs, ~15% bf here and looking forward to bulking towards ~140 lb. What would be a good pace to do that so that I don't end up looking like I gained just fat? Thanks!",1
As slow as possible if you want minimal fat. If you’ve been lifting for years you’re not going to put on more than a few pounds of muscle per month. If you’re brand new it could be more.,1
If you exercise while you gain weight you will be fine.  I really don't you're going to look fat at a normal bmi given how underweight you are.  .25-.5 lb/ week is a good goal along with good program.  You should probably be closer to the 0.5lb since you have so much room to go you can realistically put on muscle that quick.,1
"0.25 to 0.5% of bw per week. That would come out to 0.3 to 0.6 pounds per week starting at at your bodyweight. Or short answer 0.5 pounds per week all the time, every time.",1
"I’m 20M 5’10.5” 195lbs with 29.6% body fat. I’m starting to exercise again after not exercising for 6 months, but doing more weight training. I’m thinking of doing 5 days a week: one full upper body, 2 leg days, one pull muscles and core, and one push muscles with shoulders.",1
"Is this a good workout plan? And what’s a good macros goal to hit? Mostly protein tbh. I want to lose fat, but also gain muscle.",1
"For 5 days, something like PHAT would work. Alternatively, you could shell out $10 for the Stronger By Science routine bundle and get access to a bunch of different routines, all with 5-day variants.",1
"For macros, 140+ grams of protein per day and ~50g of fat would be good. Fill the rest with carbs.",1
"If you’re new to the gym just look up upper/lower splits or a PPL split (push, pull, legs). Don’t overcomplicate it. Any workout is better than no workout. I have a degree in exercise science and find myself searching for the “perfect” workout or routine and it’s mostly just a waste of time. Stick with the basics, look up form videos from reliable sources. If you’re having trouble engaging muscles, branch out to different exercises or slow down and double check your form sources and videos.",1
"As far as diet, just keep it simple. If you want to lose weight, it’s a lifestyle change, not a temporary djet. Eat simple, take smaller portions, stop when you’re full, and avoid all sugary drinks.",1
"You’ll build muscle pretty easily if you’re new. Just focus on proper lifting and getting pretty close to fatigue during each set. If it’s too easy, move up the weight just a bit the following week (I say week because you want to figure out your threshold for an entire workout, not just the one movement).",1
I’m a beginner level weightlifter. I’m 6’1 and weigh 152lbs and my current deadlift is 145lbs. Whats a good weight to start using a belt?,1
Renaissance periodization has a very good video on the subject.,1
https://youtu.be/U-S-Tb7KNb4,1
I believe he advise against using a belt as a beginner but feel free to make your own judgement,1
The only incorrect reasons to use a belt are to help fix pain or as a substitute for learning how to brace your core properly. The latter would be the only argument against using it as a beginner.,1
There is absolutely nothing wrong with using equipment like a belt at any point.,1
https://www.strongerbyscience.com/the-belt-bible/,1
Whenever you feel like you want to use one. There is no rule. Some people lift really heavy and never use one.,1
Can I substitute the T bar row for the single arm cable row? As in would it target the same muscles?,1
"I’d include them in a rotation for that slot in your training. You don’t need to just pick 1 exercise for each movement pattern, that will lead less than stellar results.",1
I personally wouldn’t swap a great compound exercise for a single arm cable exercise. You could add it in or find a different compound barbell back exercise. Ultimately it’s up to you though,1
"how much harder are pull ups vs chin ups? i’m trying to get my first pull up this year and i actually just got my first chin up from a dead hang, but i think it’s mostly because i’ve been training my biceps a lot. i can only do a negative pull up and flex hang for a few seconds 😭 they feel so much harder probably because my back is weaker… just wondering how it was for others, and is it better to keep working on the chin ups or should i do more pull up progression exercises?",1
Different people will find one way or the other easier.  Just depends on what you train more.,1
"Not much harder. Definitely keep doing pull up negatives, the best way to get better at the pullup is practicing the pullup.",1
"Chin ups are a good stepping stone to pull-ups, but you’ll want to work your back directly through compound exercises while practicing pull-ups. If your gym has one of those assistance machines those can help.",1
Can anyone please help me with a elbow pre-hab / re-hab routine. General information about elbow health is also welcome.,1
"Sounds like a great question for google, or better yet a doctor. We can’t help with specific injuries like that. There are many great resources online for learning all about the elbow.",1
Bands. 1. Billion rep tricep extension. 1 billion rep facepull. 1 billion rep curls.,1
"I was actually having this conversation with my trainer last night! His recommendation was to first off, do them at the end of your workout. You're more fatigued and so a lighter weight will be just as tiring as a heavier weight while you're fresh.",1
"And then also to not lock out your knee. Tense the quad and lock that, but not the knee. Cus of the way physics works, you're getting a lot of shirring force on your knee there, so you want to limit that with less weight and not extending all the way.",1
"Leg extensions are literally designed to move in the exact same motion as your quads, and they’re relatively low stress on your knees as long as you do them correctly with your legs aligned and without goofy instagram shit like twisting your legs left/right while you do them.",1
Your knee is a relatively simple hinge joint (with some small degree of tibia rotation). As long as you follow it then you’re fine.,1
"The leg extension was hell on my knees. Immediately after using the machine they'd be fine, but then over time as the weeks of using the machine went on, they started to have a constant pain.",1
"I stopped using the leg extension machine and now they're fine again, so I know it was the machine. I'd also add that my legs are really long, so it's possible the leg extension machine was applying more torque to them than it does for most people.",1
I switched to doing Bulgarian split squats and now I'm fine,1
"Depends on the person and how you set your body up in the machine. You want to have the bend in your leg lined up with bench so that the bench is touching the back of your calf. You also want to make sure the foot pad is fitted into the curve of your foot. Furthermore, sticking to a higher rep range and lower weights (while maintaining adequate intensity of course) will help mitigate knee issues as well.",1
"If they hurt stop immediately, legs are one muscle group that can often get away with no isolation work so you won’t be jeopardizing yourself if you can’t do them.",1
Safe for most. Appropriate loading is most important.,1
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CiOChz7DTm1/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=,1
^ a little lit review on how the leg extension is safe.,1
"Isolated knee extension exercises are most effective in building quadriceps strength/hypertrophy. Yes you can do it with compound lifts, but it is not as effective alone. Do leg extensions at a reasonable load to start.",1
"From what I researched, it depends on the person but they’re good for certain uses. If you know you struggle with knee issues, just don’t do them. If you’re a powerlifter, I’d say don’t bother with them. But if you’re lifting for aesthetic purposes they can be good. If you do them slow and controlled and with a weight you can handle, shouldn’t cause any issues. I’ve been doing them on leg days twice a week for years and I’ve never had any knee issues.",1
I currently have a broken knee cap and MLC sprain possibly tear. It's paused my fitness/wellness journey. I have a few very light dumbbells that I sit and try and use. But it's not a good pump and it's boring and it's not giving me the mental boost my old workouts gave.,1

My mood is low. I'm gaining weight back. I feel like since I'm not active I can barely even eat to maintain my weight nevermind loosing. What should my caloric intake be? What exercises can I do? How do I stay positive?,1
I've lost 70lbs so far and I don't want this to break me.,1
Should be safe to do upper body and unilateral work on the healthy leg. You could probably ask the Physio how to modify a few exercises to protect the one knee while still sufficiently loading everything else in the meantime.,1

Muscle helps with blood sugar management as it is a place of storage for glycogen as well as utilizes it metabolically to do work.,1
Walking is great. Keep that up. Start lifting too. Start light and with little volume and progress from there. This is a marathon to develop strength that should be approached with the plan to progress over years. It’s not a sprint to get hurt and have setbacks (although it happens to most).,1
What you should do should be based on what you enjoy and what gets you to your goals.,1
How tall are you?,1
Weight training is important for muscle retention. If you want to look your best when you get to your ideal weight you should probably do something in the area of weight lifting.,1
"Walking is great for losing weight, if coupled with a caloric deficit, of course.",1
"I’m struggling with some of my main lifts, the high bar squat and deadlift while running 5-3-1 nsuns. I’m get a tightness in my lower back when doing these lifts even though I’m stretching before and after. I’ve heard when doing these lifts the lower back comes into play to help support, along with the core, overall. Would more ab work and planks help beyond what I currently do, which is usually 3 sets to failure of a varying ab exercise every other day or a general deload period?",1
"I would recommend posting a form check.  I would guess it is an issue with form, potentially your bracing.",1
"Per-week, I'm doing 12 sets each of flat bench, deadlift, overhead press, squats and pull ups, 8 sets each of dips, side lateral raises, and rows, and depending on my remaining stamina for the day, a few sets of abs and correctives.",1
"The results have been good, but as of late, I've been wondering about these numbers, and whether (with respect to upper body) I'm pushing myself past a point of diminishing returns where the gains are too small to count.",1
"I'm hitting my quads 12 times a week, my hams and glutes 24 times a week (less during squats, but still enough that I feel them working), my upper chest 12 times a week (during flat bench), my lower chest 8 times a week (I barely feel them working during flat bench, my middle chest 20 times a week (I feel it worked during bench and dips), my shoulders 32 times a week (I'm counting bench sets, because though my shoulder use there is minimized, I'm still lifting a heavier weight, but I'm not counting dip sets, because I can normally do dips without a noticeable drop in performance even after exhausting myself with overhead press), and my lats 20 times a week (although, 12 are in a different ROM and 8 are in a different ROM).",1
"I wont be elaborating on the small muscles, to stay within the scope of my query.",1
"Basically,",1
"Should I cut down the number of upper-body sets? If so, how much?",1
PS: Please don't tell me to cut overhead press sets. That is one exercise I want to get really strong at.,1
"PPS: I've tried 5/3/1 and stronglifts before, to middling results. The current routine is based on principles outlined by Greg Nuckols, but I feel like I might be doing too much because of a possible misunderstanding about exercises hitting overlapping muscle groups.",1
I wouldn't cut back because you feel like the numbers might be too high.  As people advance more volume is often needed than what would be ideal for a beginner.  Sounds like you're seeing results and recovering well? I don't know why you want to change.  You're trying to major in the minors.,1
It looks like you would really benefit from following a program.  You can guess your way in the beginning and still get results.  But even then you'd get better results from a program.,1
"There is information missing.  Reps per set.  Intensity, proximity to failure, etc.",1
"You said you were working upper chest, but I don't see any incline pressing.  Also, there is no need to worry about the middle chest.  It is the same muscle.",1
"Outside of the way you are counting, I do not see too much upper body volume.  But if you are not able to recover, then an adjustment needs to be made.  I would actually try increasing volume/sets if you are able",1
"But seriously, find a good program.",1
That's all the calories you're eating? That's not enough. Up your protein and calories.,1
Did you exercise at all when going up to 260?,1
1300 calories is way too low for you,1

Depends on the position. Consider the demands of that position.,1
"Consider the training attributes of: power, strength, capacity",1
"Consider the appropriate energy systems based on duration efforts. Typical play is 8seconds, repeated over the course of a game. So PCR, anaerobic glycogen systems and the anaerobic capacity to repeat these acts are important.",1
There’s a time to train for non sport specific qualities as well.,1
So… the real question is “is this right for me right now”,1
"Since you are at the beginning of your off season, these general strength/cardio focuses are fine. Sure, getting on a tailored program can be more efficient but I’m assuming you’re young. Live and learn. Do what you like to do.",1
"If you're a football player, I'd strongly recommend looking into 5/3/1. The guy who did it is a high school football strength coach, and many of the available templates were designed specifically for high school football players.",1
"Is a bench routine of 2x5, then 2x6-10 with a lighter weight, then an AMRAP w 135 going to help increase my bench? I’ve been hitting a wall w just 5x5 and haven’t progressed in a month. (I do other chest work too and I’ve been lifting for about 6 months)",1
Pick a program that plans your progression and tells you how to deal with plateaus.,1
"Everyone stalls out on 5x5 eventually.  And i don't think your overall strategy is bad, and if you want to do your own thing that's fine.  See if it helps.  You can also move to a different program entirely",1
Benching more often won’t necessarily improve your bench press. If the bench is creating a weak link then benching as you are now will not magically fix the weak link it has created.,1
It's a fundamentally sound strategy. But if you've hit the wall on 5x5 the best thing to do is switch to a new intermediate program,1
From my personal experience I got my bench up around 10 lbs (165 lbs x 4 to 170 lbs x 5)by going to lighter weight higher reps for 3 sessions so it could potentially work for you,1
Your best bet is to find a program or plan some form of progression though,1
pick a different program please.  5/3/1 for beginners or gzclp are popular.  take a look here: https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/,1
"Do I need to worry about my age in terms of losing potential for gains? I’m a 26 year old guy. Started thinking about fitness stuff a couple years ago but have struggled to be consistent enough to make serious progress on my physique, so I’m basically at square 1.5 now. I know my natural testosterone will peak in the next year or two so I’m curious and worried as to what that means for my ability to pack on muscle over the coming years.",1
Dude go get your bloodwork done. Don’t ever try to guess it or assume it.,1
Get. Your. Blood. Work. Done.,1
Everyone.,1
Ever.,1
Not kidding.,1
"No, you are not too old at 26, or 36, or 46, or 56, or 66.",1
The best time for you to start consistently exercising was 10 years ago.  The second best time is now.  You can only do what you can with who you are today.,1
I know my natural testosterone will peak in the next year or two,1
How could you know that?,1
"To answer your actual question, no, you don't need to worry. You're 26, not 56.",1
"Testosterone is important but given you’re not hypogonadal it’s not a massive issue. You can make gains for years and years as a natural, don’t stress it and focus on the process. It’s a lifelong journey and it takes a lot time to build an amazing physique.",1
Don't bother. Once you turn 27 your dick stops working and the government sends you a wheel chair that they force you to use. Sorry you missed your window.,1
"Bro there’s guys who are 60 in my gym still lifting weights, ur good",1
Do I need to worry about my age in terms of losing potential for gains? I’m a 26 year old guy.,1
No,1
"If we tell you that your testosterone will be lower due to age are you just not going to train? If we say your gains will be more hard fought, are you not going to bother?",1
I'm almost 47. I didn't start training until I was 45. Am I wasting my time since I started so late in life?,1
What do you plan to do with the information you are requesting?,1
So what if you are... Is that gonna stop you from being the best you can be?,1
"But naa, you're still plenty young",1
Not confident enough to go to the free weight section without my PT in the gym. Is it worth using the smith machine till I build up enough confidence?,1
Thanks!,1
"Realize that anyone with an opinion worth listening to will be someone who respects your effort and wants to help. The gym is a place for self-improvement and anyone that will make fun of you is a sack of shit and worth ignoring. That being said, we’ve all done silly things in the gym and learn from our mistakes. Just go in knowing you have good intentions and understand that you’ll figure it out as you go and learn more.",1
You could do that. But I honestly would just start with free weights now. Keep the weight light and just practice your form. The earlier you learn the better. You got this.,1
Absolutely. Smith machine is better than not doing anything,1
Why does the wiki advocate for programs that hurt my ego?,1
"This is good and you should feel good.  (Also, automod apparently hates you.  Which makes sense because you suck).",1
It's not pain it's progressive overload,1
rank the wiki tabs,1
Because nobody knows training like you do Daddy Bromley,1
As long as you’re not pulling primarily with your Teres Major/Minor (which are very similar to your lat but smaller and sit near the top of your lat) there’s not much other than your lats that do shoulder extension.,1
Or I guess if your form is particularly poor and you’re using biceps/rear delt.,1
"For 99% of cases as long as you're extending your shoulder, your lats are working.",1
Your lats are working whether you feel it or not,1
4 sets is fine if you can recover. I’d recover to rotate through rep ranges as you stall. This will build in volume/tonnage rotations which are beneficial for fatigue management.,1
"I don’t think you just had top ends to your rep ranges, just train them of failure and stick within the range of 5-30. You’ll need to play around but your logs and your experience over time will guide you.",1
"I’d suggest you start with the 10+ range then once you stall you can go to the 20+ range and once that’s plateaued go to 5+ and repeat. Isolations and compounds should be trained with multiples rep ranges just like compounds, only difference is that isolations can often handle more volume as they don’t generate nearly the same amount of fatigue as compounds.",1
"You can go heavy on any exercise but isolation are usually better suited for higher reps. Remember to progress (don't always do 4 x 12 with the same weight, try adding reps/sets/weight over time)",1
Compounds should be prioritized 99% of the time so I'd throw them in later,1
Personal preference/convenience. Maybe do one for a month or two then switch to the other,1
Yep that's good,1
You're coming from a good place but the wiki has proven programs from proven coaches. That's why people get linked there.,1
Who are you? What are your best lifts or what physique have you achieved through your own methods?,1
Who are you?,1
"I'm 6'0"" and about 80kg at the moment and I want to lose a bit of weight before bulking up a bit so I'm in a calorie deficit. What would be the ideal weight for me to cut to? Right now I'm aiming for about 73kg-75kg. Is this fine?",1
"Just cut until your lean enough that can slowly gain weight without getting fat. Usually 10-15% is a fine range to work in. That being said, if you’re only 60kg at 6 foot a recomp might be your best option.",1
That’s fine. It’s really up to you.,1
That sounds like a good goal,1
"How much should I be able to deadlift and squat? I am currently overweight (postpartum) and on a path to lose fat/weight, gain muscle/strength. I am 5'3 and 210lbs.",1
"Everyone has different leverages, but at least your body on both for 5 would be a great starting point.",1
I'd shoot for deadlifting and squatting more than you do now in a few months. There's not set number,1
There is no answer for this. Everybody has different strength levels.,1
The protein powder market in the UK has become prohibitively expensive at this point. $80 USD for a 5lb tub now.,1
"I've always said this was the cheapest and easiest way to consume protein but I'm not sure anymore. Anyone have alternative ideas that serve the same purpose (cheap, easy to consume, hopefully low cal)?",1
I just checked protein prices and it's literally 5x what it cost last time I  bought it. I hope part of this is companies trying to cash in on new years resolutioners,1
Sadly I don't think so. I noticed this in november. I buy a tub every month and it just shot up like 40% in price for no apparent reason.,1
"The protein works has a big sale on at the moment, looks to be 50% off whey protein. Might be worth bulk buying.",1
I used to buy 5kg bags for what 1kg costs. Absolute madness.,1
"Cottage cheese maybe? Even at that price I think you'll have a hard time finding cheaper, and easier to consume protein. Even frozen chicken breast, which is one of the cheaper options when it comes to meat, would be at a comparable $/protein here in Sweden at least. But that's not nearly as convenient of course.",1
Skyr,1
Is this an achievable body in one year of weight training 3 times a week? (Eating right too obviously),1
https://imgur.com/a/z90dH2x,1
"The answer with this kind of thing is always it depends. Some people look like this without ever doing anything, some people get it in 6 months, some in 2 years. For some others the answer is never because their hip bone is just too wide.",1
"For the average person I'd say yes, that's little muscle at around 13% body fat",1
That depends on your starting point. Seems pretty achievable if you have approximately the right starting weight,1
"5’11, 65kg, 17 years old. No muscle mass some fat around the belly.",1
Yeah perfect,1
Even with just 3 times a week? Its possible?,1
In a year? Definitely,1
For sure. I personally try to aim for 4 times a week because sometimes I unexpectedly can't go but then my average is still ~3-3.5x,1
"The answer is nobody knows if it's possible for you, and it doesn't matter. Just lift.",1
"What is the plan if we say ""No""?",1
Give up ig,1
"So, if you can't look like someone else, you don't want to be the best version of yourself?",1
"Are there any apps available that can help with building workout routines, have access to a gym. Bonus if it shows a demo of the correct form for that workout too.",1
"You can try Jefit, I think it does that and it has videos etc.",1
But personally I'd grab a wiki program and use google sheets for tracking,1
Boostcamp has a bunch of good routines built in.,1
"Paid, but Alpha Progression has all of that.",1
"Awesome thanks I'll take a look, I'm happy to pay, if it helps its worth every penny",1
Hevy?,1
"When you use whole packages of something, let's say a package of 100g sliced ham, do you still weigh the item? To be clear, I'm not asking if you should do it, but if YOU do it. I do, because a lot of times a 100g package will actually be like 105g, and I know it doesn't really matter, but I'm anal like that.",1
"This is gonna come down to how granular I'd want my diet. If I was on a really brutal cut and I was stagnating on my results, I'd start doing mad stuff like this to see if I could find the difference.",1
"Otherwise I would never consider this a sustainable lifestyle habit. Like it would seem the only way to justify this is to make sure to never eat at a restaurant or order takeaway or anything mildly unpredictable, which is lifestyle death to me.",1
"When I'm on a cut, I do measure everything exactly as possible (but I also don't really consume anything that is packaged with a weight on it). And I absolutely do not eat out on a cut. Takes wayyyy too many calories. But it's easy enough to avoid since I'm cheap AF and rarely eat out in the first place! Shits so expensive.",1
"If I'm not cutting, I'm not counting calories and do idgaf lol",1
never eat at a restaurant or order takeaway or anything mildly unpredictable,1
"Well, about that...",1
You do you. For me the gains are never that important.,1
A lot of time the package claiming a specific nutrition value for kcal/fat/carbs/protein is off by a few % due to variations. (The NIST says they are accurate to within 2-5%) Weighting the entire content of your package makes a marginal difference that is as irrelevant as the variation in nutrition value from one sample to the other.,1
Its like trying to figure out if you burned 207 or 231 kcal on the treadmill or if your training session as generated slightly more damage than last time so surely you need those extra 3g of protein.,1
"I know realistically it has no use, but I still do it. It's just ritual to me, and I was just wondering if anyone else does that.",1
I usually do yeah. But I’m kinda neurotic like that.,1
"I recently had an 8oz ham steak that actually weighed 7.5oz. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but I realized I was being screwed by Hatfield.",1
"No, I don’t.",1
I don't.,1
can you pause a workout and resume it hours later?,1
"Yes, but you’ll probably want to warm up again.",1
I give you permission,1
Must it be resumed hours later or does days later still count?,1
"I'm still resting between sets of calf raises, last one was November.",1
I guess the question is: when does a workout become a whole new workout?,1
"But if it's days later, I'd just skip that work and make more of an effort to not have that concern again.",1
Is 531 a good program to follow as a basketball player and can you do it 3 days in a row ?,1

"You can run heavier, more fatiguing programs in the off-season. You can lighten up on fatigue and maintain during the in-season.",1
"You maybe would be able to see bits of them, but not a pretty washboard abs look.",1
"I just want to warn about skin removal surgery. I've heard it's NOT easy. It's a very painful recovery and should not be taken lightly. You'll likely be in bed for a while. So before you even consider doing this, you better make sure your calories are on point for 0 activity. You're not gonna get obese In the time it takes to heal. But if you haven't gotten your habits under control, it would be very easy to have unwanted weight gain.",1
"Ultimately, speak with your doctor about this and hear thoughts from a professional.",1
And congratulations on the weight loss,1
Mike Israetel from RP on YouTube says that doing cardio after lifting weights can hurt your gains in the gym. Does it really make that big a difference? I just do it cause it’s convenient but I’m not trying to lose all the work I put in lifting if that’s the case.,1
If I remember the video correctly he's talking specifically about minimizing muscle loss during a cut and how cardio plays into that. He also says that it isn't realistic to expect most people to lift and then wait 4-6 hours to do cardio (for exactly your reason - convenience) so he goes on to give tips and best practices for doing cardio right after lifting.,1
"He’s speaking to bodybuilders, if your goal is not optimal hypertrophy then it doesn’t matter that much… especially if it’s only 15-30 minutes cardio… if you do cardio for 2 hours after your training then it’s a different story",1
Cardio after lifting is great and recommended order.,1
"Volume of cardio is what matters. 30 min is not enough to kill your gains. 4 hours of medium to medium high intensity, then yes. Your body can only recover so much.",1
"Unless you are training for an ultra marathon, cardio will not hurt your gains.",1
"I can bench 8 sets of 5 reps of 110 lbs consistently but after 3 months of hitting the gym 3-5 times a week, I can still only do 10-12 pushups before needing to stop. Is this normal",1
"Pushups are a different exercise. For example, they require you to hold a plank position throughout, so they use your core differently. They also don’t have the same “bar path” as bench.",1
And don’t forget that doing sets of 10+ is different than doing sets of 5.,1
"If you want to get better at high rep pushups, you’ll have to practice them.",1
"Back squat question. If I do 3 sets of heavy squats and I wanna push myself a bit more, am I okay to lower the weight and try and do a set of more reps? Or does this affect anything?",1
"That's fine, many routines use those ""back-off"" sets to gain some additional volume without inducing too much fatigue.",1
This is a very common feature of good programs.,1
Which do you find better: doing pulses till failure or doing full range of motion reps till failure but less reps compared to pulses (since pulses doesn't do full ROM)? I feel like this is dumb but I wanna know which of it works more for other people,1
I’ve always preferred training with full rom,1
"If I'm training to failure I'd usually do full ROM to failure, then drop the weight and do cheat reps with a lower ROM to failure.",1
Full ROM. The things I'm not as good at require more practice,1
I'm following Nippard's Powerbuilding Program (big fan).  Only thing is he programs 1 to 2 calf exercises a week.  I'm a formerly fat guy and still have big calves.  Am I better off substituting a more under developed body part?,1
"Short version, are calf exercises important for more than just aesthetics?",1
They're not important for more than just aesthetics,1
"I'm not even going to lie: I am training calves directly for the first time in 5 years, literally for a joke.",1
"You can skip em, but it would be best to just do the program. Replacing them with, for example, biceps movements wouldn't be ideal, and it probably wouldn't grow your lagging parts any faster.",1
Why does it not look like I lift?,1
Here’s me June 2021 ~160lbs: https://imgur.com/a/uqHomW3,1
Here I me today @ 173lbs: https://www.reddit.com/gallery/108c6uc,1
"I bulked for like 6 months and just gained fat. Like zero muscle. I can hit 1/2/3/4 for my ohp, bench, squat, and dead.",1
So where am I going wrong?,1
I'm currently doing a 75 second rest timer. I'm making some other changes and I'm seeing 2 or 3 minutes as recommendations. 3 minutes seems like a lifetime.,1
"I'm looking for some confirmation/clarification that you're supposed to sit there and do nothing (aka rest), and not squeeze in some pushups or something to fill the time.",1
"Just rest until you've caught your breath. There is no need to set a timer. If 75s is enough then that's completely fine, be prepared that once the weights go up might not be enough.",1
"Rest is rest, otherwise you're doing a superset. Which can be a great tool, but should not be the default.",1
"Depending on how heavy you lift you might like longer or shorter rest times. I rest 3-5 minutes between real heavy powerlifting sets and 1 minute for accessory work, but it's really whatever you like",1
"Personally every time i finish a set, my workout log app (alpha progression, cring name i know) starts a 2 minute timer. Then i usually do something. Either listen to my music, read something or browse my phone.",1
"Once the 2 minutes are up my phone vibrates and i feel if i am fully rested. If i am i go for another set, if i am not then i wait another minute.",1
"If you just do consistent timers, don't be afraid to browse your phone in between sets.",1
"How fast should I be moving up, without hurting myself?",1
"For some backstory: I'm in my mid-30s, I recently bought myself a set of adjustable dumbbells, and other than that I've never worked out in my life. When I first got the dumbbells, I could only lift a maximum of 10lbs in each hand. After about four days, I moved up to 12.5lbs. Now the 12.5lb weights don't seem very challenging. Is it safe to move up to 15 even though I've only been at this a week?",1
"In general, how fast do people normally move up?",1
"""For each exercise but the plank, at the lightest weight available (or with empty hands), do as many repetitions (reps) as possible, up to 10. Do this three times (sets) before moving on to the next exercise. Rest for 1 minute between sets. When you can do an exercise for 3 sets of 10 reps each, increase the dumbbell weight by one step next time you do the exercise. You may progress very quickly using this method, but eventually it will take longer to increase the weight. This is okay. If you remain stuck at the same number of reps and the same dumbbell weight for 3 workouts, decrease the dumbbell weight by two steps and try progressing again.""",1
This is the progression from the dumbbell stopgap program in the wiki. It isn't surprising to move up weights that quickly starting out.,1
what would you estimate the percentage of people is in the weight room who are following an actual program/routine? or do most people just lift and wing it?,1
"The stronger and/or bigger the person, the more likely it is they got there by following a programme.",1
It probably depends on what people's goals are.  The more specific the more likely they are following some kind of program.  The less specific (or even non-existent) the more likely they are to just be doing random things.,1
"I’ve always had trouble staying on a consistent diet and getting my calories, but I’m starting to find a rhythm via slow cooker chicken thighs in “x” sauce multiple times a week.",1
"If I’m just worried about getting enough calories to function, is it worth stressing over the sodium/sugar/etc. content of the sauces/flavorings I’m using right now? Using things like Teriyaki marinade, BBQ sauce, Buffalo sauce,  etc.",1
"If you're active I would not worry about sodium/sugar intake unless it is incredibly high, which is hard to overdo when you cook at home.",1
It's a week. You're overthinking it.,1
It would have no effect in the grand scheme of things.,1
Why not do both?,1
"It would have no effect really in the grand scheme of things, but I don't see a point to doing so. Lifting and then adding in cardio would be better. If you were to walk 5 miles on non lifting days and 3-4 at least on lifting days, you'd probably be at the same point calorie wise.",1
"During my cut, I tried to sprinkle in extra cardio during the entirety of it. A 2 mile walk usually 4-5 times a week (maybe turn one of them into a run, at which point I ran/walked 4 miles). I already was cycling 2-3x a week. I just basically saw it as the more cardio I did, the more I could technically eat. And I like cardio, so that helps.",1
can i build muscle (hypertrophy) from lifting weights if i am running every day?,1
"I run every day of the week for 15 minutes each day (totaling around 2.30 miles daily), and i workout on a 8 day cycle with 6 days of work and 2 days of rest. I train two muscle groups each of the 3 days of work, rest, repeat. I have a fast metabolism with a bmr of 1,646. I am in a calorie surplus aiming for around 3,100 calories daily. would it be best i just pause running and pursue hypertrophy? my main goal is hypertrophy and i looked up if you can do both and i’m not getting a lot of yes.",1
if you make sure you eat enough you will grow and gain muscle. Running wont prevent hypertrophy.,1
Yes you can build muscle while running,1
"2.3 miles is basically nothing... so absolutely you can build muscle while running. As long as you eat enough to support your runs and your lifting, you're fine.",1
Where you might run into problems is if you were to start doing LONG distance running since that burns a ton of calories before you can replenish them. I've heard that's worse off for muscle building (but I have not done reading on that).,1
"But look at different types of runners. Your long distance runners are basically twigs, because moving a larger mass around for that distance requires even MORE energy. But when you look at sprinters, they're much bigger cus they need explosive power and only need to maintain it for a short distance. If you're not trying to be a pro, then it doesn't matter what your body type is.",1
"Its like I have a buddy who I cycle with. You know how many cyclists are skinny things with thicker legs? Well he's basically body builder in terms of build (well... he is an ex body builder, so yeah lol) But cycling doesn't hinder his lifting. But the bulk he carries on his upper body does slow him down cycling, but he's no a pro so it doesn't matter.",1
"Already doing 4 classes of fight sports a week (boxing and fencing), on tuesday lunch and night and thursday lunch and night. These won't move and I'd like more sports.",1

"Saturday : chest, triceps and shoulders",1
Sunday : back and biceps,1

Would that work or should I move thing around ?,1
Legs is done with fencing,1
"I would disagree here. You could absolutely add some lifting to the weekends, but I wouldn't neglect your legs",1
"You are absolutely right, didn't put enough thought into it. Bodyweight volume legs but heavy mass weights upper body will end in chicken legs aesthetics 🐓",1
"While footwork is important in fencing, it doesn't train your legs that way.",1
"If you're going for aesthetics, do some actual leg work.",1
"Do you guys prefer a strict 3x5/5x5 or, evolving rep ranges like 3x4-6/5x4-6?",1
"All my preferred programs (such as SBS, 5/3/1, Juggernaut Method) involve working in a variety or sets and rep ranges.",1
"My OHP and DL are increasing on pace, but my squat and bench aren’t. Squats seem especially tough. They wear me out.",1
"Numbers - bench 260x5, squat 305x2, OHP 165x5, DL 345x6. Been working out consistently a few months.",1
"Routine - M/W/F, ABA, BAB, etc 3x5 at 5/3/1 % then 1x5 of 2nd set A - bench 4x5, pull-ups 4xreps, other, squat 4x5 B - OHP 4x5, pendlay rows 3x8, weighted dips +50lbs 3x10, DL 4x5",1

"I currently struggle hitting 85 kg for more than 14-15 reps (full depth tho, 1RM is parallel). Not a single time have I managed to hit the required RIR. I always have to stop because I can’t catch my breath. Heart rate shoots up to 170. I‘m using the Valsalva technique and that always worked fine with 5-8 reps.",1
Any way to fix it? Conditioning? I’m already taking a 3 minute rest and would hate to increase that. 4 minute rest allows me around 2 more reps on the next set compared to 3 mins (tested that today).,1
"My cardio isn’t too bad, 2 intense sessions/week in summer, 1 in winter of either swimming, cycling or running.",1
Can someone please help me out with what a reasonable amount of daily protein I should be aiming for? Because the numbers I see online are all over the place and start to seem insane at the higher ends.,1
31M 225lb 6ft beginner,1
Goal weight: 200lb,1
Bench press: 225lb (comfortably without a spotter),1
Current daily calories: 2000-2500,1
Current daily protein: 130-150g,1
"I’m seeing protein levels online that range from 60-250g of protein a day. Before I took a year long hiatus from the gym, I was following a strict diet that put me at ~200g/day at the same calories. But that diet was soul draining to a certain point. Nothing but chicken, eggs, tuna, cottage cheese, Greek yogurt, brown rice, bread, legumes, and protein powder; with little to no room for any additional flavor or variation. And I really don’t know if that extra protein had a significant difference.",1
"I’m not trying to become the strongest guy in the gym or get particularly lean. I’m just trying to live a healthier lifestyle while losing weight at a reasonable pace, and get more muscle definition.",1
"I’m considered obese at my current weight. Which is also where my confusion with recommended protein comes. Let’s say that there’s me at 6ft and 225lb, and a hypothetical man at 6ft 150lb. Let’s say we are both at the same fitness levels and follow the same exact workouts identically. Why would I need up to 40g more protein a day?",1
Your lifts have nothing to do with that. Just get .8g-1g of protein per pound bodyweight and fill the rest in with fats and carbs.,1
I tore my labrum in my shoulder. I have just stopped working out chest and shoulders because of it but now my body is out of proportion.,1
Any workouts I can do that wouldn’t agitate my shoulder that much?,1
I know I need surgery but that’s about half a year out.,1
I also tore my labrum but was able to do pretty much any lift with minimal issue after a month or two. Limit overhead stuff. Strengthening the muscles around it will help even if you’re doing low intensity.,1
Also make sure you’re diligent with physical therapy. I got my surgery in high school and quit PT early like a stupid teenager and dislocated my shoulder again a year later.,1

"Hello- I have been lifting for approx fifteen months and have decent progress , and now want to switch emphasis to running for a bit (training for a half marathon) . What would your recommendations be for minimising strength loss as I do this? I will be aiming to lose a little bit of weight as well as I do this.",1
"In particular, what’s the best way to manage squats/leg day with running (intervals and long runnings approx 3-5 times a week)? I’m sure I could manage upper body but lower body is what I’m most concerned about.",1

Have you tried eating something small before lifting?,1
"I was wondering if anyone had any advice for someone who lives in a very cold climate, and wants to do an indoor sport that can be done solo? Are there any that come to mind that would work well that use anaerobics and cardio?",1
"swimming, if you have a local indoor pool",1
"Bouldering.  Climbing is more cardio focused, but unless there's auto belays set up (most climbing gyms have a couple), it requires a second person.",1
"I always loved Racquetball. You can really get sprinting back and forth, although it is really more fun with people.",1
"Rock climbing is great, but expensive",1
Swimming is an option if u find a gym with an indoor pool.,1
Weightlifting is a sport too!,1
"Went to the gym on Monday for the first time in forever to start a new weights program. Wanna lose some weight and eventually build some muscle. Did a pull workout and the doms in my biceps, delts and traps is unlike any soreness I’ve ever had.",1
What’s the best way to manage? Do I just push through and keep working and engaging the muscles?,1
"Start slow. Push through, if you just stop working out it will take 2 weeks to recover.",1
Start with low weights. Increment slowly and steadily. Follow a recommended routine.,1
"And then, when you still get DOMS (cause you will), deal with it. It goes away after your first few sessions.",1
Not proud of body weight and really want to build muscle. Should I focus on cardio first to bring weight down and then lift ? Or should I be doing a fair share of both?,1
"As a beginner you have the potential to develop muscles while cutting since your body is going to have to quickly adapt to the new stimulus, it won't be a lot but it's better than nothing for sure. And of course there are the benefits of learning proper form and maintaining a consistent schedule, so when it's time to start bulking you will be primed for making gains.",1
"I'd do both. 531 for beginners in the wiki is designed to balance both. Cardio will burn more calories immediately, but building muscle is also important as it will raise your metabolic rate long-term.",1
"For weight loss focus on the diet and lowering your calories. Lift weights for a muscle. I always try to sneak in cardio when I can. Walk a lot! If ur up for it and enjoy cardio def do it, it won’t hurt. I recommend a blend of weights and cardio but as a beginner it can be tough doing both at first. I found it easier to get “addicted” to weight lifting vs running",1
That’s what I’ve been doing! Thank you for the advice glad to know I’m on the right track,1
Start lifting consistently and fix up your diet. No need to wait to lift unless your weight makes it physically impossible for you to do so. This is probably not the case unless you’re morbidly obese.,1
Both and adopt a healthy diet. Focus more on lifting than the cardio,1
would it be a bad idea to replace my horizontal pulls to pull-ups to increase frequency on them to 3x a week as opposed to 1-2x a week?,1
currently i'm running a full body routine so i alternate between pull-ups and rows but i'm struggling to get more than 5 reps on pull ups at the moment,1
Rotate to chin-ups and progress on those. That should target the muscles well and enable you to improve. I would not replace your horizontal pulls with vertical pulls as that would create a gap in your program and as a novice that’s definitely not something I’d suggest. Are you running a minimalist program?,1
"Used the tdee calculator and it suggests I should be eating 250g+ of protein a day (78kg, 184cm, 22 years old, exercise 6-7 times a week). Is that realistic? I'm vegetarian and eat roughly 100-130g a day and I've had to do some diet adjustments to get to that.",1
A good rule of thumb is 1.75 g protein/kg bodyweight. For you that comes out to 137 g per day. 250g is extremely excessive. Here is an article on protein intake: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/athlete-protein-intake/,1
"Cool, thanks, it did seem weird but it said something about a 30/35/35 split - I guess that may be more realistic for someone doing less exercise and so eating less.",1
"Try to get 120-130g (at least .7*body weight in lbs) - its basing your protein goal off of your height, weight, and high activity level. It could be unexpectedly high to you if you're eating lower calories than the calculator gave you (depending on your goal) but around .7 per pound is a good floor.",1
Working my way around TDEE too.,1
"Cool, thanks.",1
"What's your usual diet? 👀 Just curious as to how you get 100-130g protein a day, haha.",1
1 protein shake a day - 25g,1
Breakfast: Either 250g yogurt with some cereal or a sesame seed bagel with peanut butter + a banana - 20-35g protein,1
"Lunch: mozzerella burger sandwich/pasta/omelette usually, or I eat at uni, so it can vary - 10-35g protein depending where I have to eat",1
"Dinner: Varies massively but some things I've had recently: Saag halloumi with brown rice, Black bean+tofu chilli with rice, Seitan burger+chips, Large spanish tortilla. Goal is to get 40g from this, but usually ends up being 25-40g.",1
Snacks: Nuts or a protein bar - 15g-ish,1
"I think it usually ends up being around 100-130, occasionally I'll go out to eat or cook something for dinner that isn't so good protein-wise because it seems interesting. Overall I think my diet is probably a bit fatty so I need to look for more clean vegetarian protein sources.",1
200g would be fine. There are Vegan Whey out there. Hard to do on a Vegan diet but possible. If you can reach around 180-200 constantly you will be fine!,1
"I'm just vegetarian, I have one scoop of whey powder a day, will there be any issues if I have two (in terms of balancing my protein intake to get complete proteins)? I've only been lifting for 3 months so I'm still a bit new.",1

"Cool, thanks man.",1
"Out of curiosity, what would happen if someone neglected training their upper chest (not doing exercises like incline bench press, incline dumbbell press, etc)?",1
If you are doing flat bench and ohp then you prob wont see any meaningful difference.,1
"That area would be small and weak. Depending on the severity you could experience shoulder issues, but that's unlikely.",1
Can you elaborate? Are u working out other parts of ur body? Are u already muscular and ur just laying off it? Are u doing shoulders and other parts of the chest? Bc if ur only not doing upper chest it’s not gonna impact you terribly but would be better if u did for a more impressive ohsyigue,1
Is it really true that high reps small weight is better for weight loss and high weight low rep for building muscle. What if I wanna do both?,1
Calorie deficit is the only thing that matters for weight loss.,1
Eat in a calorie deficit (for weight loss) and follow a proven routine (to build muscle).,1
Is it really true that high reps small weight is better for weight loss and high weight low rep for building muscle.,1
Nope.,1

I also red some posts where people tell it make them depressions, ED, killed their emotions etc. it sounds almost like i bought kratom or something like that :D I red those only on internet forums, so idk, maybe i just looked too deep into it, where one guy says anything, and others saying yep its true, but my question",1
"Do you think ashwagandha is safe supplement ? Im taking it obviously mainly from its main benefits as active person, i take 500mg daily (which is reccomended dosage on label). Is it safe without side effects in this amount, or anyone noticed any significant side effects too ? Thanks",1

If I have some fat to lose but mostly want to gain muscle (mainly around my legs and butt lol),  how many days should I strength train vs how many days should I do cardio to make sure I can still grow my muscles while still losing a bit of fat. My worry is that by doing cardio too many days, I'll not be able to grow muscle as easily, or if I do too little then my excess fat just stays while I grow my muscles.",1

Body type description in case it matters:,1
"I'm 22F, weigh 110 lbs and height is 5ft2. I have a Wendy Williams body type with most of my fat on my back, stomach, boobs, and arms, and then pretty skinny legs. So although I don't weigh much at all, I look bigger and more morphed because of how my body distributes fat (if that's even how that works). Without working out at all, my body looks best at 103 lbs bc there appears to be less fat on my upper body and it evens out my shape a bit but I also lose fat and muscle in my legs which is still not ideal for me. I want bigger legs and a butt to even out my shape a little while also regaining my somewhat flat stomach that I lost this winter.",1
"103lbs is underweight for you... I would not recommend dieting back down to that. At 110, you're at a healthy weight, so I highly disagree you have some fat to lose. You likely just have muscle you need to gain cus you're likely sitting at a skinnyfat state.",1
"As for what you should do... read the wiki and pick a routine from there. It ultimately doesn't matter how many days you work out. I did 3x a week for a while (just now swapping to a 4x plan) and I made fantastic results (also a woman, if it matters!) If you want to spend more days in the gym, feel free to pick a more frequent plan. But if you want it simple to start, 3x a week, full body is very easy to stick to.",1
"As for cardio, do it as much as you like. Cardio is good for you because it gives you better endurance which is useful while lifting (Faster recovery). Also good for your heart health as well. It does burn extra calories, but this isn't going to magically burn fat. Fat gets burned if you are in a calorie deficit. Doing cardio can help put you there.",1
"HOWEVER, I do NOT think you should be in a calorie deficit. I think you should be eating at a slight surplus and look to put on some weight. If you want to build muscle, trying to maintain your weight (or lose weight) is just going to make you spin your wheels and not give you results. Slowly increase weight until at least 120lbs, if not 125lbs. Then diet back down to 110.  If you do so slowly (say aim for about a half pound a week) and really focus on lifting consistently and heavy, you will absolutely build some good muscle mass and when you cut back down in weight, you will look totally different. You might not have THE look you're wanting after one year, but you just keep working towards it by building up and cutting back.",1
"Also, please train both upper body and lower body. Women do not bulk up like men and having the upper body strength to hold heavier weights means you can better load your legs to get the results you're looking for. And please don't be afraid to go heavy. Like 2x body weight squat could absolutely be a long term goal that you could reasonably get to in 2-3 years (if not sooner).",1

I returned to the gym in the latter half of 2022 after taking 2020-2021 off. When I was that age in the 2000s, the gym staff wouldn’t let you anywhere near the weights before high school, it was considered bad for your growth. Now there’s multiple groups of middle-schoolers working out together every day, and I go to a city-run gym with a very retired clientele. It must be even more of them at cooler locations. Mentioned it to my brother and he said it’s TikTok/Instagram influencers driving it.",1

you will definitely get bored of it. if you keep doing it when you're bored/tired that's when you know you have a chance of success.,1
Walking with weights meaning farmers walks? I LOVE them,1
Some of the best advice I can give: if you’re getting bored you need to try new stuff. The absolute best exercises you do are ones that you find fun and/or can be consistent with. If ur bored then trust me try some new stuff and find a challenge that engages you,1

IMO this is a lot. For me this would be too many exercises and too many sets. Imo if you need nearly 40 sets on your leg day you are doing something wrong.,1
I would not do this program. I wouldn't try to modify it either. I would toss it aside and pick a different program that gets good reviews.,1
"The volume seems all over the place, not to mention excessively high for some muscle groups, you're doing an almost comical amount of exercises, and your rep schemes are simplistic.",1
"If I were you, I'd follow something like PHAT instead. Or nSuns 5-day template.",1
You have a link to that? I really want to try to get away from squatting and deadlifting heavy as I’m trying to stay away from back issues as much as possible. Still trying to put on about 5-10 lbs till I hit my goal while doing so,1
Sure. Here's PHAT and here's nSuns(just switch to the 5-day view at the bottom).,1
"Do you have a history of back issues? If not, squats and deadlifts will only make your back stronger rather than more fragile.",1
I got exhausted just reading the 11 different exercises OP is doing on Friday.,1

"I just started working out after a long time. I'm getting up there in age (I'm 25), and want to use my last wind of youth to work towards building a well-proportioned and functional body. I don't want to suffer from things like back pain, knee pain, and so on.",1
I know one thing I can do is address the muscle imbalances now which contribute to these sorts of chronic issues later in life.,1
"I'm curious if anyone can list out, or point to a source that lists out, the sorts of imbalances and muscles implicated in all of these chronic conditions. Be it upper back pain, lower back pain, knee pain, hip pain, and so on. For instance, I know that lower back pain is related to imbalances in a quadrant of muscle groups.",1
"I'm doing this so I can outline the implicated muscle groups in a very systematic way, and also hopefully find out which muscle groups are weak for me, and pre-emptively strengthen them to both build a good basis for strength and conditioning, and avoid future chronic pain.",1
I'm 40. Didn't realize 25 was the last wind of youth....,1
I turn 40 this year.  I think tonight instead of lifting I'll just go start digging my grave.,1
That sounds dangerously close to conditioning. Better pay someone who isn't old (at least younger than 15) to do it for you.,1
I'm 42. Apparently I've been dead for 17 years.,1
"I'm 37, so I must be nearly at death's door as well.",1
Me too. Well crud. This is depressing. Things were going so well too.,1

"I'm getting up there in age (I'm 25), and want to use my last wind of youth to work towards building a well-proportioned and functional body",1
"My man, you could keep building muscle non-stop for the next 15 years.",1
"You're 25, not 65.",1
"You're overthinking this. Get on a good full body routine from the wiki, do conditioning and mobility work on your days off, and after a few months of working out you'll have an idea of what needs extra work. If you haven't been working out, everything is weak and needs strengthening.",1
"You're thnking too hard.  There is no imbalance to fix, ""age-related pain"" is just the manifestation of overall weakness from lack of activity paired with an unhealthy diet.",1
You don't need to reinvent lifting and exercise.  There's nothing new you need to solve.,1
https://thefitness.wiki/getting-started-with-fitness/,1
"I have bad posture, will training my back improve my posture or do I need to do more?",1
"Lifting can certainly help improve posture but if the cause of it is not muscle weakness, no.",1
I feel like lots of it is because lack of muscles,1
Not necessarily. It can. It depends what's causing the bad posture.,1
"Depends on the cause of the posture issues. You'll often want to train other parts of your posterior chain too though, not just your back.",1
Pilates with a proper qualified practitioner does wonders for posture. I see an osteopath who runs a side business with Pilates and since doing it my posture is hugely better. I’m at least an inch taller.,1
I had read pilates can reduce the appearance of the waist. Thats why Im hestitant to do it. Did pilates change your waist?,1
I wouldn't worry about this.,1
"I haven't done Pilates, but definitely lifting a lot. Maybe my waist isn't as small as it could be, but everything looks more sculpted and it looks wayyyy better anyway.",1
"Can you consciously get into good posture, as judged in the mirror? If so, do that consistently throughout the day. Strength training may help a bit, but nothing is as good as holding good posture.",1
The minimum is zero. You technically don't have to eat any and your body can operate fine.,1
120g is fine as long as your hitting your calorie target,1
You don't need carbs at all. Your body can pull all the energy it needs from fats technically.,1
"However, where carbs are beneficial is all the micronutrients and the fiber. So don't focus on tracking your carbs, just focus on eating an assortment of fruits and veggies.",1
"You absolutely DO NOT need carbs like bread, pasta, cereal, etc (ultra processed foods). I agree, those leave me feeling bloated (but for me, that doesn't mean full!)",1
Your body can pull all the energy it needs from fats technically.,1
*and from protein.,1
"Carbs can be useful when exercising, but are non-essential.",1
You could look at carbs that are easy to eat and digest like white rice. That would likely not bloat you up much.,1
I Cut carbs completely. Now only really eat them if my SO want to eat some pasta for dinner and its her turn to cook.,1
"zero, carbs a non-essential macronutrient",1
"Wow, all the people saying you don't need carbs! Yes, technically true, but if you are training hard and trying to bulk, you're going to feel pretty crappy on a zero-carb diet.",1
"Say i want to eat 200gm of chicken breast for dinner. Do i weigh 200gm before cooking, or after cooking, cuz after cooking it loses some weight.",1
"I know its kind of hard to weigh before especially if you meal prep.  There are usually selections in the tracking apps for cooked chicken.  not as accurate as the raw measurement, but even those aren't 100% accurate anyway.",1
Just stay consistent with how you measure and the noise will be eliminated as you track and weigh in.,1
"I can't think of a scenario where the nutrition info on the box isn't representing exactly what's in the box.  maybe pancake mix is an example where it doesn't, I don't know.  just always assume it tells you the info for what's inside when you buy it unless it explicitly tells you otherwise",1
"Don't face any issues with my barbell squat but when doing the machine hack squat, always feel like there's something off with my right ankle and the heel starts raising. What do I do to fix it?",1
Try raising your feet higher up on the platform. You can move them wider too if that's more comfortable.,1
"Your heel is probably raising up to compensate for lack of ankle mobility. You can try playing with different foot positions (up or down, wider or narrower, angle of the toes) to see if a specific setup feels better. Otherwise, you can wear lifting shoes with a raised heel to artificially increase your ankle mobility and let you go deeper.",1
"Don't think of it as a cheat either, the more you get into that deep squat position the more strength you'll develop in that range of motion (aka mobility/flexibility).",1
"Does anyone find that lifting weights/cardio helps with anxiety? I struggle with anxiety and the last thing I want to do is go to the gym, but if it helps I will.",1
"Yes. exercise in general will; more bloodflow, endorphins etc. Lifting is also a series of challenges you set for yourself which you then overcome, which can build confidence in yourself which translates to less anxiety (ime). Working out generally comes with better sleep, more attention paid to diet, etc, all of which will improve your anxiety as well.",1
"Thanks. Appreciate you responding. So even though I don’t feel like it, I should go anyways?",1
Definitely. I don’t feel like going all the time lol. But having a routine is also helpful in reducing anxiety.,1
Honestly outside of medication and therapy I can’t think of a better way to cope with anxiety than lifting,1
It can. Will it help immediately? Dunno. Will it help for you specifically? Dunno either.,1
"But improving your physical health absolutely helps with your mental health. You can't fully do one without the other imo. But if going to the gym and lifting weights sounds boring to you, don't do that. Maybe find a class that catches your interest more. Like kick boxing or something. Get yourself moving doing something you enjoy. And then you can move over to lifting as well. I personally HATED the gym  years ago. I absolutely love it now.",1
I find it to help a ton!,1
"I definitely find value in cardio (and lifting) with anxiety/stress/depression. Now to be clear, I am not diagnosed with any of these, but I DEFINITELY feel much better after running for example..",1
"Another suggestion is meditation (even 10 minutes a day) it has helped me in my worst times, I still use every now and then when I'm down..",1
"Again, non of this is medical advice please go talk to a medical professional. This is merely anecdotal evidence.",1
I find adding activities with a positive feedback loop to my life builds up confidence and reduces anxiety.,1
“A weak man is not as happy as that same man would be if he were strong. This reality is offensive to some people who would like the intellectual or spiritual to take precedence. It is instructive to see what happens to these very people as their squat strength goes up.” - Mark Rippetoe,1
I know Rip is a controversial figure to say the least but I do think there is more truth in his quote than we care to admit.,1
"My inner quad is stronger than outer, and I believe this is why my right knee gets on fire after leg day.",1
Any fixes?,1
"My wrist is acting up, probably a light sprain.  I read somewhere I should work with lighter weight but add reps for a week or so - which sounds about right but I wanted to make sure.",1
Good question for a physical therapist.,1
"How can i fix this issue: So when im doing a dumbell excersise, i'll get this sting in my left thum/palm",1
"While I understand both Barbell Squats and Barbell Lunges work the hamstrings/glutes to a degree, does one of these exercises work the hamstrings/glutes more than the other?",1
"Lunges would hit the glutes more, especially if you took a wider step. Short step= more quad less glute, longer step = more glute and less quad",1
they both work glutes but not really hamstrings.,1
typically lunges but if you are squatting low bar it would be quite similar,1
Why don't you do a regular squat with a barbell instead?,1
That is fair enough. If you're running out of DBs to progress you can also swap to Bulgarian split squats. You only use 1 leg and you can hold 2 DBs making it so you can progress 4 times as high.,1
"You can also do DB squats where you hold the DB on your shoulders allowing you to hold 2 instead of one, making it so you can progress further.",1
"My program has a linear progression of 2.5kg every week, but the smallest plate is 2.5kg, so on both sides that would make 5kg, how do I progress?",1
Alternatively see what kind of clips your gym has. Sometimes they weigh 1.25kg a piece. That of course means that you will have to be able to do the exercise without them aswell.,1
"Or you could also invest in 2 1.25kg plates and bring them, they aren't that expensive i believe.",1
Progress 5kg every other workout. Try to match or beat your reps by 1 from the last week on your second workout at a weight.,1
"Add the 2.5kg to both sides. The point is to progress until you stop progressing, at which point you come back here for a review.",1
"lat in this context stands for lateral, meaning to the side, not for latissumus dorsi (the muscle)",1
,1
you should be feeling your shoulder!,1
"Lat = lateral raises. Should be feeling it in your shoulder, the side of your shoulder, the lateral head",1
That's the problem with abbreviations,1
Not sure what happened during my workout today. I’ve been waking up earlier and prob sleep deprivation but I was able to do 3 sets of 4 reps for bench for a weight of 145 pounds.,1
Then all of the sudden on the fourth set I couldn’t even unrack the weight. Also feeling a lot of elbow pain recently so probably need to stop locking out elbows.,1
"Incline dumbell press I’ve been able to do 8 reps of 55 pounds, but today could barely do like 4 ok reps . I tried the 45s and got 12 reps but felt very heavy.",1
"I get that I’m probably sleep deprived and I was sick during the last week and a half and a bit of stress from work, but can all this explain a sudden drop in strength?",1
"Feel like I'm not doing squats/deadlifts right, ever (deadlifts especially) and its putting me off doing them at all, I can't afford a coach. Is that normal starting out, is it something you just get better at the more you practice?",1
You don't have to do them perfectly for them to be effective. Progressive overload and effort are more important than chasing perfect for. Consider posting a form check if you want advice.,1
yes its normal to not be good at something when first starting it and to then get better at it over time and with practice,1
"It may seem that simple to some, but when you have no guidance other than youtube, and every where you look people give different advice, cues etc. it muddys the waters. Even form checks get differing advice anywhere from it looks OK to a full breakdown of what's going wrong so it's hard to navigate.",1
"yep, thats why you just have to practice practice practice. I learned entirely on my own through videos and practice, Ive never had anyone in person coach me on any lift. If you are willing to put in the effort you can learn to do them!",1
is that normal starting out?,1
Yeah.,1
Is it something you just get better at the more you practice?,1
Pretty much. Pair that with form checks and the Wiki article on Improving Your Lifts and you get better and better.,1
"Thank you. I have been trying to improve my form but haven't a clue if I'm improving it if that makes sense, I haven't had a time when I've thought OK I've got this down (yet).",1
For Reddit PPL am I expected to always increase my heavy sets for bench by 5 pounds each week? For example say I bench 5x5 145 on Tuesday. Then the next Tuesday the program says do 5x5 150.,1
But I’ve been finding it hard to do so for the past couple of months and have to increase reps instead of weight. I think I’ve been lifting for only 5-6 months consistently.,1
In terms of nutrition I’ve been eating around body weight in protein but am running a 500 calorie deficit so maybe this hampering my strength gain rate?,1
The past month has been brutal with 145 pound bench where I started with 3 sets of like 3 reps (but got 1 set of 5 reps). Then next couple of sessions I’m recovering from illness and can barely get 3 sets of 3 reps. This session I get 3 sets of 4 reps but can’t even unrack weight on 4th set.,1
I know it does get harder to progress bench as you get closer to body weight but I do weigh 180 pounds approximately. Haven’t been sleeping as well the past couple of days and am recovering from sickness. I need to get through this.,1
For Reddit PPL am I expected to always increase my heavy sets for bench my 5 pounds each week?,1
"only up until a point, this kind of progression certainly does not last forever",1
if you scroll down the page it offers solutions for when you can no longer progress linearly,1
"Being in a deficit probably isn't helping in your case, no. Have you followed the failure and deload protocol yet while running the routine?",1
"Looking to start spinning classes at my gym next week to get in more cardio, as someone who mostly does weight training and boxing style cardio classes what should I expect? Any tips?",1
"A spin class can be as tough or as easy as you make it.  You can set the resistance lower and can ultimately go at a slower pace. If you get tired, you can always drop the resistance and just slowly move your legs to catch your breath even if the rest of the class is doing higher paced stuff.",1
"Also, I would arrive early and talk with the instructors about getting your bike set up right and make sure you feel comfortable. With regular cycling, soooooo many people have their seat at the wrong height and this makes your life much harder. You basically want it where when your pedal is all the way down, your leg should be nearly fully extended, just a slight bend in your knee and no risk of your leg locking out. While holding onto the handles, your want a slight bend in your elbows. You don't want to be reaching, but you don't want them too close. There's variation of comfort depending on your body, but generally that's what you're aiming for.",1
"Also, if you have bike shorts... wear them! Bike shorts have a pad built into them and are designed to be worn without underwear. It provides some comfort to the seats and the lack of underwear will help with any potential chafing. They aren't required, but if you feel like the seat is really hard after your first ride, you'd be better off with a pair.",1
Thank you for all this!,1
Spinning is a whole other level of cardio imo and can get really intense. If you’re new to it I’d recommend looking for a shorter class first (eg 30mins) and see how you take it. I also prefer classes personally anyway as I find any longer than that and I get bored lol,1
"EDIT : also be sure to adjust your spin bike and figure out how to control the resistance etc, ask your instructor / a friendly fellow spin classmate if you’re unsure!",1
Spinning is tough. Start with a beginners class if you can.,1
"My gym only offers an interval based spinning class and Lesmills RPM. I used to do Lesmills classes (Cx, Bodypump, Bodycombat and Bodystep) a few years back so I feel I may be more familiar with that style of classes than the interval one. I think I'll try to spy on the classes this week and see which one looks less crazy. Thank you!",1
"Leanfit Costco Whey protein - is it the same quality as other, more expensive protein powders?",1
Could you run programs like Fierce 5/StrongLifts/Starting Strength every other day instead of 3x a week (eliminating consecutive off days)? What would be the pros/cons of doing so?,1
"Yeah, that be fine.",1
The consecutive off days are mostly just due people operating on 5 day work week schedule,1
Absolutely. The consecutive off days are just because most people find it easier to work into their schedules.,1
Con - you won't get a stable schedule.,1
Pro - You'll work out slightly more so get slightly more volume.,1
"I am a 5'3 male and 160 lbs, gotten way stronger than I was before but now feel like I should focus on losing some body fat (because there's a lot around the belly lol) before I return to bulking.",1
Is it possible to gain strength/muscle and lose body fat if I go on a calorie deficit and still eat my protien goal (180g protien a day)? Really trying to understand this because it's really giving me a headache,1
"It's possible to get stronger in a deficit, yes. I wouldn't really count on gaining any muscle mass though.",1
"Hey, guys. I came from calisthenics, now I'm doing weighted calisthenics with some weights as well. For the chest I do weighted dips, weighted push-ups and decline push-ups. I prefer weighted push-ups then bench press because my mind muscle connection is best with push-ups, I do bench press and feel nothing, just my shoulder feeling weird haha. But my question is, which other movement pattern I could do to incorporate on my workouts as auxiliar (hypertrophy focused) for the chest?",1
"On a PPL split, are Shrugs really a Pull Day exercise? I always associate the exercise with shoulders and thus Push Day.",1
"I also think of Deadlift as a leg exercise, but I see some PPL splits that out it on Pull Day.",1
"it doesnt really matter, if you want to do shrugs on Push day and Deadlifts on leg day thats perfectly fine",1
Is it necessary to wear belt for barbell rows?,1
I don't see why a belt is necessary for any lift.,1
"nope, a belt is never necessary but can be beneficial",1
It's not necessary for any movement if you don't want to. I personally don't bother wearing my belt for rows.,1
"So again i have been bulking now and getting some good progress on squats. No progress on upper body however... Gained 6kg so i'm now 86kg. My goal is to be lean, otter-mode like this https://i.imgur.com/cbsplU8.jpg https://i.imgur.com/M7Mtvtx.jpg https://i.imgur.com/qYa1O1S.jpg",1

"I accidentally did a higher deadlift weight than anticipated. So I was doing 105 lbs (45 bar + 70 weights) and was supposed to increase the weight by 5 pounds total yesterday. As I was doing it it felt a bit heavier but I didn't think much of it. After I finished and was unloading, I noticed I had the 55lb bar, meaning I increased by 15lbs. Feeling a little extra sore this morning in my lower back than I probably would've. Next time I do deadlifts again, I should drop back down to the weight I intended to do right?",1
"go at whatever pace you want.  If you completed the sets for how much your program said to I'd keep progressing from your new number and tell myself ""congrats on being a little stronger than I thought""",1
"I been scared of deadlifts but kinda growing out of that, I'm currently doing my first ever set and kinda feel it in my lower back.... Is this normal?",1
Yes.,1
"super normal, it's working your lower back.  It will probably be pretty sore for like a week, which is also normal and will go away if you keep at it.",1
"Just in the fact that you're new to it, there's probably technique aspects you can improve upon. Keep watching technique videos (especially from reputable sources like Juggernaut training systems and Dave Tate) and keep practicing. Try to understand how you should be bracing, how one should break the bar off the ground, and what muscles should drive each part of the lift. Understand why it's a ""hip hinge"" and it's not just 100% pulling with your lower back.",1
"Can anybody explain how or why treadmills calculate differently from each other? For example, I see that people burn 350 calories walking on a treadmill with an incline of 12, speed of 3mph for 30 minutes.

They're all very loose estimates that should be ignored anyway.,1
If you’re inputting bodyweight that can change it. Those estimations are also highly inaccurate anyway.,1
"Why do the beginner programs recommend all sets of one exercise before moving on to the next, vs cycling through to rest the first muscle group before coming back around to it?  Is this based on exercise physiology or convenience/equipment utilization?",1
This isn't a beginner program thing. Just the way some/most programs are structured.,1
"I very rarely superset and never do ""cycles"" and I am pretty far from a beginner.",1
"convenience, you can cycle if you want.  if you're at a public gym where people are waiting on the squat rack and you're somewhere rowing with your plates still on that's pretty rude tho.",1
What’s a good protein-packed breakfast option I can make and eat in 10 minutes or less?,1
"Depends on your idea of ""protein-packed"", but a simple bowl of rolled oats could get you around 30-35g.",1
"Apart from that, I like to make blended shakes the evening before.",1
What kind of oatmeal are you making that has that much protein in it??? Or are you dumping a scoop of protein powder in there?,1
Eggs.,1
Boiled eggs are my favorite. I will make them in bulk batches so I always have some in the fridge. Peal and eat takes like no time at all. 4 eggs is about 24g of protein and like 300 calories.,1
But you could always make some extra chicken the night before or something and just microwave some leftovers. You don't need to eat traditional breakfast foods for breakfast.,1
Oatmeal with Greek yogurt and protein powder,1
"i haven't slept too well last few days and my chest, where it meets my shoulder, on both sides, is still sore. I should be doing bench presses again today. I have been doing heavy weight less reps. would it be better to do less weight more reps today or would I be good to just do as I've been doing?",1
edit: it feels less like DOMS and more like a knot that if I press it hurts more than DOMS does,1

Anyone ever run the Soviet six week peaking program? Just wanting some thoughts for peaking for a meet,1
Does anyone have experience with muscle memory? How long did it take you to get back to your old numbers and physique.,1
"from what point? there's a huge difference between taking 6 months off and taking several years off. There's also a difference between coming back after being sedentary for 4 months vs 4 months where you didn't train in a gym but remained generally active, worked a manual labor job, etc.",1
"So, I'm starting to work out this week to aim to get in better shape and be more healthy. I've already got my diet planned out, but the actual exercise is stumping me. For context: I'm 6.2, 194lbs. My legs and arms are skinny and somewhat toned, but I have a slight gut and, what I'd assume are called, love handles that distend about an inch from my waist. I don't know what exactly I should be focused on. My goal is to have a better physique, losing my gut, and having some definition to my muscle. I don't want to be completely jacked, but I want to look good and have obvious muscle. The problem is I don't have the monetary means to access the gym, nor do I have much equipment at home. I have weights and bands, but that is it. Other than that, I have Beach Body workout programs that a family member also uses. My initial idea was to utilize P90X, but adapt it to fit my needs and not fall into the traps I've heard that program has. My initial idea was to try and utilize P90X for a sort of at home 5 day split, but now I'm unsure if that'll work for burning my belly fat effectively. My other plan is to go with the program, but replace certain videos like Plyo with jogging. Honestly, any feedback is welcome. My ultimate goal is to get rid of my gut and get into a good physic within 3-4 months. I'm tired of looking like an uneven stick figure.",1
Why doesn’t pre workout do anything for me? I almost never get a caffeine buzz unless I drink an obscene amount (usually 2 energy drinks at once) and I have only ever felt that beta alanine tingle about 3 times after having gone through a 30 serving container. I don’t use it daily either,1
"because you have a very high caffeine tolerance. you might just have a preworkout that doesn't have a super high beta alanine dose, but the tingle itself doesn't indicate effectiveness.",1
"Hey guys! So very simple question, I would like some feedback on my lifting form (squat and deadlift). Is this the correct subreddit? If not, where?",1
reply to the pinned form check comment at the top of the thread,1
How much rest does the body need? Can I safely repeat a workout in the same day? I ate a little too much at lunch and now I need to burn some calories.,1
I ate a little too much at lunch and now I need to burn some calories.,1
Outrunning a bad diet is not going to help you in the long run. Eat less for dinner if you ate too much for lunch.,1
"depends on the workout, your level of conditioning, and your overall level of accumulated fatigue. It's not something that specifically requires a given minimum time from one workout to the next, fatigue management is generally going to matter on a longer timescale than that.",1
Don't stress over eating too much in a meal. That is not a big deal if it happens once or twice.,1
This is highly individual.  People recover differently based on everything from age to genetics to what kind of 'roids they're on.  You cannot outrun your fork and it's not a great plan to try.,1
This is perfect for you,1

replace my dinner with for example carrots+peanut butter,1
"Don't do this. Eat a well balanced meal that contains a good source of protein, healthy fats, and  vegetables.",1
read the wiki for sure.  rowing won't make you much stronger.  if you have a pull up bar and some rings the r/bodyweightfitness routine is a great program if you don't wanna go to the gym,1
"Yes I would make your first priority to cut out the junk.   I caution some against peanut butter.... it is healthy in some senses, but it is also very caloric dense and easy to overdo it if weight loss is your goal.",1
"If you aren't losing weight after a month or two of cutting out the junk, you should probably start tracking your calories and consider how to cut back.",1
Should I track lifting progress just by seeing increases in lifting weight over time or also measure muscles?,1
Does your program not lay out progression and have you record your lifts?,1
"I'd track lifts, because trying to measure your body is going to be skewed by the inevitable fat gain.",1
"For fun, you could measure your body from end of cut to the next end of cut and see how much muscles grew on your bulk but after you've cut out the fat.",1
When looking at the weight gain during a bulk at what timeframe should I look in order to analyze if I'm gaining at a proper rate? For example I want to gain about 500g per week. Now in one week my average weekly weight increased by 1kg but then the next week it decreased by 500g.,1
Ideally your weekly rolling average would be increasing at your desired rate.,1
Do you track RPE of your workouts too? I've only been tracking sets and reps but maybe I should start with RPE tracking also.,1
"I think I need to switch programs. I’ve been running GZCLP for the past few months, but I’ve recently started my winter job which is super active. I ski for about six hours a day at a high rate of intensity. I can’t really recover that well with my work schedule. I want to keep lifting because I like going to the gym and I want to keep the habit going, but the GZCLP workouts feel like too much. Which recommended routine should I switch to? I want to get strong and look good naked but need to balance gym stuff with a very physically demanding job.",1
"Pick a 5/3/1 template. Because skiing is largely a lower body sport, I would probably cut some of the lower body volume at first. Then you can add back in some volume as you figure out how well you can recover",1
I have leg day tomorrow. Going to start with my squat and then a few isolating movements on machines. What sort of cardio should I do? I was going to go for the stair machine but not sure how it will effect any work I do on my legs?,1
if you do your cardio after your leg work out it will not affect it,1
anything would be a fine choice,1
Is my form wrong if I feel some pain on my shoulder joint after I finish planks? It doesn't hurt during the exercise but only after when I lift my elbows off the ground to rest,1
There are many potential causes of pain. We can't know what is causing your pain.,1
can only do rows.,1
Why can you only do rows?,1
"Can you fully replace Rows with Machine Rows and Bench Press with Pec Fly's ? I can only to the gym when its full of people, so the benches are all taken, except the chest machines",1
Pec flyes are not a 1:1 replacement of the bench. The rows are probably fine.,1
You can.  I would probably try to replace bench press with either machine chest press or dumbbell chest press.  I would still do flys as well,1
"I got a Fitbit for Christmas, starting exercising again have really enjoyed looking at my stats. I noticed that my resting heart rate has dropped which is great but is it normal for it to go from 72bpm to 63bpm in less than 3 weeks? I haven't even been working out consistently or that hard. Like since Christmas I've worked out 5-6 times 30-1 hour long each. Probably a dumb question but from what Ive read after a Google search it should be taking longer to see improvements?",1
That is fast. I think it is more that the watch is getting more data from you and smoothing out it's readings.,1
"i'm applying for a military scholarship, and in order to be considered, i need to pass a fitness test. as of my practice attempt, i failed miserably! i'm unfamiliar with this subreddit and the fitness world in general, but i need a lotta help! i'm petite-framed and female, and have a very hard time building strength. the goal is 1.5 miles in under 15 minutes. i also need to do crunches or planks (not sure which) and push-ups. how far out should i schedule the test, and how hard do i need to practice each day? i would be so grateful if anyone could give me any recommendations 🙏 my leg strength isn't that bad, but my upper body is VERY lacking. when trying to run, my legs can always go on, but my lungs feel like they're bleeding out, and my abdomen feels like it's splitting apart 😭 how can i fix that? also, should i eat a little more than normal? i'm within the bmi limit with plenty of wiggle room, so it's not a concern.",1
"You need to start doing more of those things. Or better yet imo, start working out with a proper routine and just get fitter overall. It'll be better for you! And for cardio, start running and doing what you can and build up. I second the couch to 5k program.",1
"Eating a little bit more would help you for sure, gives you a bit more energy and gives your body more to work with to build muscle. Also, make sure you're getting enough protein in as well.",1
"As for how long it'll take you to improve... That's hard to say. I'd maybe hold off scheduling until you have a better idea, or if you have to schedule now, schedule as far out as you can.",1
"If your only goal is to pass those things then you should do those things everyday.  Doing pushups, crunches, and running everyday isn't a full body workout, but that's how you get better to pass that test.  I would run everyday, maybe look at a couch 25k program you can get an idea how to build up.  A 10 minute mile is not a break neck pace so you should be able do do it with practice.  Once you get up to running a mile and a half without stopping start working on speed. Going to a track where you can pace yourself can help.",1
"Do push ups, crunches, planks daily.  Do multiple sets to get more volume in.",1
If you really need a break take 1-2 days off a week.  I don't think 3 days per week is gonna get to where you want fast enough.,1
"Even if you are starting far away from where you need to be, 1-2 months will likely get you there.",1
Give yourself 3-6 months to see good strength and muscle mass gains. If I were you I would hire a trainer because you will get the best results with a plan of what you need to work on and how to improve it,1
"60 vs 45 degree incline dumbell curls, which is better for biceps?",1
Running a program that uses a percentage of my back squat for front squats. I found it to be too much weight and had to drop it to complete my sets. What does it mean if my front squat is weaker than my back squat? I was doing 4x8 at 60% but had to drop to about 45%,1
Means you’re not used to the technique once you do it for a while you’ll probably do 60% easily,1
"Everyone's front squat is weaker than their back squat, just a matter of by how much. Don't worry about it, lower the percentage however much you need to in order to finish the reps.",1
What training programs take the least amount of time of setting up equipment through the workout.,1
"I live in a small space and have a rack, barbell, plates, and adjustable dbs.",1
I was thinking for example if the main lift is Deadlift that my workout would be:,1
"Deadlift - 5x3-5 (do some shrugs end of every set) RDL - 4x8-10 Barbell Row - 4x10-12 Walking Lunges, Abs",1
Lots of 5/3/1 templates have a single compound per day.  That's the easiest way to cut down on setup/warmup time.,1
"If I can only lift 3x a week, which split is better?",1
Full Body Full Body / Upper / Lower,1
"Fullbody 3x a week, like GZCLP or 5/3/1 For Beginners.",1
full body 3x,1
Do you still allow yourself (and is it okay) to have a treat meal every couple weeks to let off some steam when doing a cut? I’m counting everything and in a deficit other days but looking to allow myself to have an extra “uncounted” deserts every couple weeks. Thinking this would allow me to still live a little and enjoy those seasonal things and cravings that may come up. But don’t want to sabotage myself and my goal to finally get jacked.,1
"I'd honestly be concerned if I viewed nutrition from the frame of ""allowing myself"" and ""treats"".  That's the sort of food relationship my young child has with food.",1
"If there is food I want to eat: I eat it.  The biggest thing for me has been establishing eat habits where I'm not denying myself.  I don't exist in a constant state of temptation and denial: I'm eating exactly what I want in order to meet my goals.  If there's dissonance there, I need to re-evaluate my goals.",1
"My philosophy is to not make life miserable during a cut. Nobody is paying me to be shredded. I'm not trying to compete on stage. When a dinner out with family or a holiday comes around, I participate and enjoy myself. At most you normally set yourself back a single day of deficit eating, which in my case doesn't matter at all.",1
You gotta do what works for you.,1
"For me, if I'm just trying to shed a few pounds, I'll be more lax with my diet.",1
"When I'm cutting to lean out for summer, actually aiming to get down to my lowest health bodyfat% I'm comfortable with, I don't cheat at all, and in fact my diet is pretty damn strict (absolutely no ultra processed foods. Basically meat, veg, fruit and plain dairy). For me, I know that the cut is temporary and I'd rather be strict for 3 months, than looser for 4. BUT, I also love eating a whole food diet and don't feel restricted cutting out processed foods.",1
"How long are you planning on cutting for?  If it's like 6 weeks than cheating is a little silly, if it's 6 months than yeah take some breaks.",1
"What are your favorite things to eat for protein? I'd prefer stuff that can be stored in a room/office since sometimes I don't always have kitchen/fridge access, but any recommendations welcome",1
Trader Joe's has peanut butter granola with protein that I take with me everywhere because it is perfect,1
Whoa sounds like the perfect thing for my situation. Gotta make a stop this weekend. Thanks a bunch and I hope you have a great week,1
"Thanks!  They also have like fake pork rinds that are fortified with protein and are really good, i literally eat them every day as well.  They're called ""spicy porkless plant based snack rinds"" which is a terrible name but they're delicious.  less calorie dense than the granola tho so like a little more awkward to travel with.",1
How do you know which day is day 1 and which day is day 2?  On a long enough timeline: you can start the program on any day you want.,1
It doesn’t matter. Probably just a preference thing. Also because chest is the best muscle group to work.,1
"I've been lifting for about 2 years, my current SBD is B:315, S:515, D:600 (Not sure if they're really necessary). I'm about 6'1 and hovering around 197-200lbs. I estimate my BF to be in the 18-20% range. I need help deciding on what way I should go, I obviously want to be bigger and work on the muscle groups that I need to improve on, but I don't want to gain any more fat and reach a higher BF territory. I've been in this limbo for the past few months, as I have been on short-term bulk and cut cycles, but I want to stick to one for the next couple of months. Any input from you guys?",1
The general advise is bulk until you’re unhappy with how fat you are and cut until you feel you’re too small.,1
Since you said you don’t want any more fat I would say to cut,1
I've used that ideology but it sends me spiraling when it comes to both of those mindsets by the end of a bulk or cut cycle lol. ty for the input though,1
"What, currently, is more important to you: putting on more muscle or being leaner?",1
How do I learn to squat below parallel without rounding my back?,1
What exercises should I do to increase mobility?,1
r/flexibility has a squatting progression that will likely help. I think it's just literally spending some time in the squatting position every day.,1
Depends on your personal leverages and joint mobility but from my experience most people who have trouble hitting depth have limited mobility in the ankle and hip. Stretches and isometric holds at the bottom of a squat could help.,1
If I do GZCLP 4 days a week instead of 3 should I stick with bench/squat and deadlift/OHP days or switch to bench/OHP and deadlift/squat days to make it a more upper and lower body routine?,1
Does it matter?,1
"I’ll be going from MWF to Monday, Tuesday, Thursday Friday",1
I stuck with bench/squat and deadlift/OHP when I ran it 4 days/week.  It ultimately won't matter.,1
"Is alternating between to strength workouts over 2 weeks beneficial? Or should I just stick to the same workout every week? Or doesn’t make much difference? I want to keep progressing with deadlift, squats and bench press, so maybe keep them at least once a week? Thanks",1
Running two different workouts is fine for sure,1
If you're talking about 2 programs though that's a different story,1
i would pick a program that aligns with your goals and then run it for however long it lasts for.,1
"Not really in most general cases. Focus on general fitness, right. If u wanna get better at compounds, then keep doing compounds, every week.",1

"I mean its a little like asking why is lifting heavier ""better"" than lifting less.",1
Not really... form counts on some things more than speed....,1
Not on a Stairmaster.,1
OK... nice vibe by the way,1
Stairmaster is mostly a cardio machine so all they care about is getting their heartrate up.,1
"I may be ignorant hear but it’s just stairs, climb them how they’re comfortable, right?",1
“Form” is blown way out of proportion. Controlled movement is key,1
I did a bit more research and... 1.Maintain Your Posture. To put strain on the right parts of your body—the glutes and hamstrings instead of your back—slow down and get your posture right. 2. Don't hold on... 3. Do two at a time... 4. Switch it up... 5. Add weights... 6. Practice intervals... 7. Monitor your Heart rate...,1
"I weigh 88kg - 5'11"" (up 20kg since i started lifting 2 years ago) yet have little to no body fat. I'm confused does muscle really weigh that much? I would say my legs are quite big and I do take Creatine, do these really have that much of an impact on my weight?",1
If you had little to no bodyfat you'd be very unhealthy. It's also very unlikely you gained 20kg of just muscle in the last two years. So the most likely situation is that you actually have some body fat.,1
"Hey people,",1
I want to start gym again but im working 24h shifts usually twice a week and usually don't have a stable sleeping schedule other days of the week. Should I try beginning gym to get healthier and look better or is it futile with that kind of life style?,1

Wacky sleep schedule + going to the gym is better than wacky sleep schedule and not going to the gym.,1
It's not futile.,1

I'm on android I'm looking for a new workout app that understands different programs progression and will automatically change each weeks workout weights (such as increasing Squat/Dead by 10lb and Bench/OHP by 5lb  when you succeed on the sets for GZCLP).,1
I've seen Strong recommended a lot but i don't see how to set that up.,1
Perseus seems to do it but it's UI is kinda ugly,1
"Boostcamp used to do it, but they recently removed automatic progression (no clue why, it worked fine).",1
Alpha progression has this to some extent and is very easy UI.,1
"Every time you do a session it will tell you how much you did last time, but you can set it to whatever increase intervals you like and then all you have to do whenever you hit the top of your rep range is click on the weight and then up it by 1 and it will do the increase you have specified.",1
"It also has an automatic 10RM calculator shown for each set to try and determine if 100kg for 12 was more work than 105kg for 8, though i wouldn't trust it completely.",1
I have a few questions:,1
"when doing cardio do the same progressive overlord principles apply? every time you run/swim/whatever should you always try to aim for a faster time/longer run? I've heard of a lot of athletes running the same distance/time for years and never increasing it, is that the same as lifting the same weight and never increasing it?",1
,1
"Next, does heart rate matter during cardio? I've heard some people swear by it and I've also heard some people say it doesn't matter.",1
"You should get better over time but for cardio you do not want to red-line it every workout.  Common advice for running, for example, is to run most of your miles at a pace that would allow you to have a conversation.  Over time that pace will increase.",1
"When you structure a running program, every workout isn't always an attempt at a distance/speed PR. You may hold back in some workouts to control fatigue. Perhaps the goal is to maximize total volume over a long time period in a way that isn't possible if you're burning yourself out workout to workout.",1
"Similar ideas apply to lifting too. Advanced lifters aren't training squats, deadlifts, bench in a way where they're just trying to set weight/rep PR's every single time.",1
"""Do 30 seconds more running than last time"" can be a good way to think about it early on so you learn to ""push"" but you want to figure out a program at some point.",1
when doing cardio do the same progressive overlord principles apply?,1
"In broad strokes, yes.  Obviously the application is a bit different.  But adaptation requires stimulus, and not changing anything is the opposite of stimulus.",1
"Next, does heart rate matter during cardio? I've heard some people swear by it and I've also heard some people say it doesn't matter.",1
"Depends on who you talk to.  Some people love it.  I hated it.  RPE and target paces work better for me.  In the end, they all are trying to accomplish the same thing.",1
"In cardio the main variable to overload is total volume. You’ll kill yourself trying to make every run faster or longer than the previous. If this week you did 10 total miles, next week go for 12.",1
"Another approach is to keep volume more or less constant, and do some speedwork. The intervals might be faster over time.",1
"It’s also ok to keep the same volume of training for a while. Cardio is often step loaded. Work at the same level for a few weeks, then bump up.",1
You can get programs for running just like for lifting. Check Halhigdon.com.,1
"Heart rate is just a way of measuring intensity. It can be helpful if you calibrate it to your actual max HR (do not use a formula, they’re too high for many people and too low for many others).",1

I’ve only recently joined gym (started like 3 months ago) and I can say that I’m definitely getting into shape. :) One biggest concern for me is that I’m already rather skinny and while I can see that I’m gaining muscle, I’ve also started to lose weight which is frightening. I really don’t want to lose weight but instead gain more while keeping myself in shape. Any tips regarding that? I know I should be eating more :p but anything besides that advice? :D I should mention that I also do a lot of hiking and walking in general. Maybe I should do that less often?",1
https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/,1
Thanks. That was fast! :D I’ll give it a read! 👍🏼,1
Answer is you need to eat more. Gravitus has a macro calculator that’s really good and can give you an approximation of your caloric intake for gaining or maintaining weight.,1
Sorry to say it but ur solutions are ease up on movement (bad idea!) or eat more.,1
"Look into calorically dense, low volume foods. Nuts come to mind, for example",1
"At times you’ll have to force yourself to eat, but such is our plight",1
"Yes, I understand. Thanks for your reply.",1
I am a formerly ridiculously skinny kid who always struggled with eating enough. I know your pain.,1
"If you’ want to gain weight you need to eat, there are no exceptions. Trying to out-train your diet is like trying to run your car without gas. I now have a gazillion shortcuts and tricks/habits so I can get enough food in, but it’s genuinely a skill.",1
I know it’s not the answer you probably wanted. It sucks. Bodybuilding is fucking hard :),1
Just wondering after playing with the tool all weekend. Would you take fitness advice from GPT-3? I feel like it's quite easy to get some info in there and it can give you some recommendations and simple facts.,1
"GPT-3 is a writing tool, not a search tool. It generates text,   but it's not always accurate. Don't trust it too much.",1
"However, it can be useful for simplifying complex ideas. I tested it out by asking it to explain the 5/3/1 system and it created a very good summary.",1
how many times a week should you train your hip flexors,1
Somewhere between one and seven,1
"Like others said it varies for everyone.  I like to gauge my flexors with my squats.  When I go really heavy, are my legs bending in or out?  Adductors may be stronger than the abductors, etc.  Otherwise I just do them when I do leg day.",1
"When might you start noticing a difference in weight/inches/appearance? I've been working out 4-5x per week (about 30-40 min. each time) since late Nov/early Dec and while I'm trying to gain weight I've actually stayed at the exact same weight and measurements, except that sometimes my waist is actually bigger despite doing no exercises targeting the abs specifically (I do legs and glute days and arm/upper body days). I still look just as flabby and honestly see no difference at all. Is it still too early to notice much of a difference or am I doing something wrong . I know this kind of thing can differ from person to person but is there a length of time where I should absolutely start noticing a difference so I know I'm doing my routine correctly?",1
"If you haven’t gained any weight then you’re not in a surplus. You didn’t state what your goals are so I can’t really tell you exactly what you’re doing wrong. I suspect you aren’t following an optimal program, aren’t sticking to your diet and probably aren’t pushing yourself hard enough.",1
What do your workouts consist of? I'd have a look at the programs in the wiki and do one that fits your schedule.,1
"Weight is controlled in the kitchen, physique is controlled in the gym.",1
"If your goal is to lose weight you should be firstly eating less.  The lifting part of losing weight only burns a few calories, comparatively.  The kicker is the gained muscle mass will increase your fitness and metabolism to help keep the weight off later.",1
"If your goal is to gain weight, then lift really hard and eat really hard.  Also depends on your workouts.  Long distance runners can eat like nobody else and they're thin and lanky.  Bodybuilders are obviously huge, but they also eat a ton.  They're huge because they're training for hypertrophy (size), not strength or endurance.",1
"Everyone responds differently and goes at their own pace, but the biggest mistake you can make is tracking progress with just a scale. Beginners can gain a bit of muscle and lose a little fat at the start so it’s possible your improving but just not showing it yet.",1
"Hey, I started working out in July 2022 and by now there’s a noticeable difference - I’ve lost body fat and also gained muscle, plus I keep a strength log and have noted significant increases in strength.",1
It’s a slow game but once you see your results it keeps you going. Make sure to take pictures now so you have a reference point,1
"Regarding your progress, what are your height weight measurements and what is your caloric intake?",1
Should you do cardio before or after you lift,1
Whichever is a higher priority to you.,1
"for most people, after is probably slightly better",1
Why do u say that? What if the main goal is improved cardio performance?,1
"What they said. Do first what is ur main focus. You’ll be entering the second with more fatigue and won’t be able to do as much as if you were fresh, so lift weights first if muscle growth is the main goal, or do cardio first if the main goal is Better cardiovascular health and stamina",1
"You can also switch up the order depending on ur mood. Keeps things exciting, but recognize it’ll make ur results harder to track",1
"Depends on your focus.  If your focus is cardio, do it first.  If it's lifting do that first.  Whichever you do last will likely suffer in some way but that's better than not doing it at all.",1
Whichever you prefer/is more manageable,1
Where is the ideal place the barbell for front squat? I feel pain in my front deltoids and collarbone when loading,1
"It should sit on your front delts, I find that if it barely touches my neck that's the sweet spot. It also will be uncomfortable at first so you're not doing anything inherently wrong. I'd post a form check.",1
Oh is there a specific place for it on the fitness reddit or just add it to my post?,1
There's a comment for it stickied on these daily question threads.,1
You want it saddled between your front delt and trap. If it’s painful just swap it for another bilateral squat Movement.,1
What's your favorite way to use large amounts of ground turkey in a simple way.,1
"Monster mash (Stan Efferding's term, just a mashed bowl of food). Brown all your meat, cook a bunch of rice/potatoes, eggs, and spinach, then portion everything out and use a food chopper like this and chop it all together.",1
Make taco filling. Eat tacos.,1
Turkey burgers.,1
Turkey Meatballs with tzatziki,1
Chili,1
Bolognese sauce.,1
hi i’m new to the gym and was wondering if it’s good gym etiquette to wash the attachments for the cable machine and dumbbells or should i just stick to only washing seats?,1
just cause some people at my gym never wash dumbbells or the attachments whereas I have been for a good week. Am i being a plonker?,1
Some gyms I've been to ask that dumbbells/barbells not be wiped down with cleaner because of rust issues. I don't know how much of an issue that actually is however. Definitely wipe down anything you sweat on. The more clean you leave things the better.,1
"If you have sweaty hands then wipe things you have held, else just seats are usually fine. You can also ask the gym staff, since it can be specific from gym to gym.",1
"If you aren't leaving blood, pools of sweet or other bodily fluids behind then any wiping is just theater anyway. Do whatever everyone else is doing",1
"With HD1900 machines, they read a “actual weight” and “selected weight” on either side of the machine. The selected weight side is double the actual weight side. How am I supposed to read these machines to properly track what I’m actually lifting?",1
Pick a scale on one side and stick with it.  The numbers are really only applicable to that machine anyway.,1
"Specifically curious in the case I go to another gym with real numbers, I would like to have a guesstimate as to what I’m actually lifting.",1
"Machines are different from gym to gym anyway. Don’t expect “70” on one machine to match “70” on another, they could be drastically different.",1
I would like to have a guesstimate as to what I’m actually lifting.,1
"What you actually lift depends on the specific leverages, angles, friction and amount of pulleys in the machine.",1
Leverage and pulleys have a HUGE impact on the actual force you need to apply (like doubling or quadrupling or halving it...). So you can't really guesstimate from afar at all.,1
It comes down to how many pulleys the cables go through and on most machines and cables you can see it.,1
"If you use a machine where the ropes go through 1 pulley, but then go to the same machine where there are 2 pulleys, then you're lifting half as much.",1
"Most machines correct for this, but it comes with experience to determine how close you are to the normal weight you lift.",1
"If you accidentally set it too low and easily hit the top of your rep range, then up the weight and don't count that set.",1
If you’re training with a good proximity to failure you should definitely count that set even if you go over the arbitrary rep range set for yourself.,1
If you did your set easily then it wasn't close failure.,1
Just pick one and consistently use that unit in your logs. There’s no need to overcomplicate it and I wish the machine wouldn’t include that for this reason lol.,1
"Question about - for those that do - how folks combine compound lifting programs and ring exercises. Is it doable to do both together (in same gym sessions, different days, alternate weeks, do rings maybe during/as a deload week, swap exercises like ring dips for bar dips)?",1
"Context: I've been following the Bigger Leaner Stronger program for 3 months and really enjoy it, making great progress (I do 4 days a week, currently considering switching to 5 - includes compound lifts and isolation exercises).",1
"I recently decided to get a set of gymnast rings to explore that more. From what I hear, those exercises can be pretty challenging. Maybe overthinking it, but just was wondering whether I would be putting too much strain/overtraining (or just doing too much on same thing).",1
Yes you can progress from dips to ring dips. It's a good alternative to weighted dips when dips get too easy.,1
"Yes you can do both, they’re just exercises that can fit into your templates. Just don’t pick exercises that are too technical as that will hurt your hypertrophy outcomes as they’ll be so technical that you won’t be able to adequately target the muscle to grow.",1
"Can someone please tell me if this is a good weekly training routine?  I’m 5’ 8”, 150 lbs looking to stay lean and put on weight:",1
3 days - lifting at gym or a home ab workout,1
2 days - Muay Thai class,1
1 day - boxing class,1
"The martial arts training is sometimes tiring but more cardio than anything, feel like I could do a lift after some sessions. I stopped running because I want to put on weight.",1
Seems fine. I'd definitely do a program from the wiki for your lifting. 531 for beginners is designed to be done alongside a sport.,1
Ok thank you. Been lifting for 2 months and haven’t been able to really increase my weight. Any reason for this?  I’m especially bad at bench press. Currently Plateauing at 4 sets of 8 with just one plate.,1
"It's probably lack of appropriate programming, bad form, and/or you're not eating enough to grow.",1
"Can’t really say if we don’t know what there session consist of. It’s like saying “I have 3 meals, is this good?” then giving 0 details. We need the beans!",1
"I’m an equestrian, and am working out every single day (in and out of the saddle). I gained tons of muscle recently, but have retained some fat. I’m currently taking “burner” supplements and drinking protein shakes, as well as making some changes in my diet (smaller portions, few carbs, calorie deficit, etc.). Is there anything else I should know or be aware of? Any pitfalls? I don’t want to lose the muscle I gained, but certainly want to be rid of the fat that remained. Fyi, 26f, 130ish lbs, 5”5",1
"You should quit the ""burners."" Not only are they snake oil, they can have dangerous side effects.",1
Drop the burner garbage.,1
You don't NEED protein shakes if you can get your protein from your food. There's nothing magical about them. Aim for .8-1g protein per 1lb body weight. Roughly 100g would be plenty.,1
"Otherwise just making better choices and being in a calorie deficit is all you need. But also, please realize carbs aren't the enemy. I'd argue ultra processed carbs are (bread, pasta, etc) but eat plenty of fresh veggies and fruits!!",1
You really don't have much weight at all to lose. You're healthy as is. So don't go trying to chase a super lean state!,1
Eat a calories deficit and eat around 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight. If you’re still training you shouldn’t have any issues keeping the muscle you’ve gained.,1
When you cut you’re going to lose muscle. Full stop. The best cut just ensures you lose the least amount of muscle possible. The slower your cut the more you keep.,1
"The only way to cut is calorie deficit. No exceptions. Reducing calories, cardio, fat burner pills, etc all do the same thing (digging the deficit deeper).",1
Btw absolute best case scenario your fat burner adds like 1% efficiency to your cut. Your food accounts for the 99%.,1
Each program has a specific deload protocol.,1
That really depends on the program you use.,1
"In some you retest for your TM, some just reduce your TM by a set percentage.",1
