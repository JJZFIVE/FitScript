"If I know the amount of calories and the amount of protein in a given amount of food, how do I calculate the amount of protein per calorie?",1
The amount of protein per calories = (the amount of protein)/(the amount of calories),1
Protein has 4 calories per gram,1
Lose weight,1
I've hit a complete wall on my nsuns routine as I'm doing a bit of a cut. Would you all recommend I deload and stick with nsuns during the cut or switch to a routine that is more about lower weight/higher frequency?,1
Either option is fine.Here’sa good post on the subject.,1
"Mixed results with increasing 1rm squat/bench. About 2 months ago I decided to start benching and squatting everyday after reading someones post about doing the same thing mainly to get to 3 plates on bench and increase my ridiculously weak squat of 305 at the time. My bench has shot up from 255 to 305, squat slowly rose to 345 and stagnated in the last month. I'm 5'10 86kg , been lifting off and on for a few years I'd guess. with most of that time doing nothing but variations of push-ups as I was in jail and then prison. I eat about 200kcal over surplus and slightly over 200g protein everyday. I don't take any other supplements. I workout 6 sometimes 7 days a week My routine for the past two months looks something like this. Flat BB bench 4x8, Decline DB bench 4x8, Incline BB bench 4x8. Squat 4x5, Seat leg curls 4x8, laying hamstring curls 4x8. This is done before my actual workout of the day so if I'm doing chest that day I'll do that all first then add in some fly work, cables, or and machine presses. If I'm doing legs il add in lunges, glute kickbacks and deadlifts. My question is why have my legs seemingly stagnated while my bench continues to rise. I'm giving both about equal time and volume and I know my chest and arms are much more developed so I'd expect those lifts to rise much slower. Tips please",1
"I would pick a proven program from the wiki and do exactly what it says. The Stronger by Science strength templates are excellent, as are any of the 531 programs. They’ll make it so you can easily see if you’re progressing appropriately and are pretty customizable.",1
"Hello, I had a mildly concerning cholesterol check the other day so trying to get back into a fitness regime.",1
I'm starting the beginner course (Basically Phraks GSLP I think) and was curious how long each session should take? Today it felt like I was waiting for equipment longer than I was using it...,1
My workouts last anywhere from 60-90 minutes depending on how rushed I am and whether or not I do cardio after.,1
Hey 👋🏻. Got a mid-chest muscle sprain from pushups about 2 weeks ago. I really wanna get back to working out as its taking a toll on my mental health rather than physical. Wanted to ask if ab workout like crunches and exercises involving dumbbells for the abs will cause the injured muscle to get worse? Im really paranoid as i tried a few crunches and felt a tiny amount of pain which is why im being cautious,1
"I've started lifting weights around 4 months ago, and I'm making slow but steady progress but the problem is that my grip strength is holding me back on my deadlifts and RDL, like I know my body can get more reps but I can't hold on to the bar any longer and I'm considering getting lifting straps, is it too early to get one? Worth mentioning that I tried the hook grip and it didn't help much and I recently started training my forearms 3x a week",1
It's not too early to get straps.,1
"Use chalk and a mixed grip (one hand over, one hand under), and double your volume on rows and pullups.",1
"If you're set on using wrist straps, then just drop deadlifts in favour of good mornings. The only benefit of deadlifts over good mornings are the grip strength. Assuming you're already doing rows and pullups, you're already targeting the forearms, lats and upper back.",1
"My grip strength is also the limiting factor on pull day. I bought straps and it was the best decision. But I try to do as many sets as possible without them, and dead hang at the end of every workout to improve grip strength.",1
If you're training your grip then there's no reason not to use straps. Don't let your grip be a limiting factor for posterior chain development.,1
"I am starting to cut and really not wanting to add more size to my legs, just maintain. 25f, played a lower body dominant sport in college… could I sufficiently maintain leg muscle (assuming adequate diet/protein) just training legs 1x per week on a modified PPL? I know I could run PPL 5days/week and start the following week on the previous week’s 1x (so PPLRPPR LPP… so on), but I’m simply curious if legs 2x/ per week si absolutely necessary to maintain and not gain. (Also to note I DL on pull day)",1
One day a week should be enough to maintain muscle mass if you train close to failure.,1
"It takes a very, very low amount of volume to maintain muscle mass. One day a week should be fine. Just make sure the protein and intensity is there.",1
"i’m not flexible enough to get both hands on the barbell at once for barbell back squats, what are some stretches i could do",1
Shoulder dislocations with either a light band or a broomstick. Go as narrow as possible without having any pain and keep your elbows extended throughout the whole motion.,1
"For the following 4 exercises, how would you rank the importance of wearing flat shoes like Chucks, as opposed to regular sneakers like Ultraboosts?",1
Barbell Back Squat,1
Barbell Conventional Deadlift,1
Barbell Bench Press (Flat),1
Barbell Standing Overhead Press,1
I'd want to wear a flat firm sole for all of those,1
Back squat and deadlift will benefit from a flat sole considerably. It doesn't really matter at all for bench or OHP,1
"squat = dl >>> OHP > bench, personally.",1
"Assuming you're doing this in a gym, I'd ask if you can just take your shoes off and go in socks while doing the lifts. Every gym I've been to has been ok with that so far when I've asked.",1
Any tips to reduce forearm involvement in BB rows? I find myself pulling the bar for the last few centimeters way more with my arm muscles to make the bar touch my torso.,1
Straps,1
Why do you want to reduce forearm involvement?,1
"One thought that always comes up is to possibly retract your shoulder blades and ""pull with your elbows"". Another thought is if you NEED your forearms for the last few cm then the weight might be a 5 or 10 lb too heavy?",1
I watched Jeremy Ethier's pull routine and he recommends Close grip supinated lat pulldown over regular lat pulldown. for past months i had been doing this instead in my pull day but recently i feel that doing this and bicep curls is too much because i am working biceps twice. is it better that i switch to lat pulldowns regular and bicep curls instead?,1
You can work biceps twice in the same workout. You would probably be better off following a recommended program in the wiki though.,1
Assuming sleep and calories are fine: being unable to recover between workouts and early burnout following a program implies low work capacity?,1
"There are several factors, work capacity is a big one (especially if you are a relatively new trainee) but things like stress, illness, non exercise activity, nutritional deficiency, poor programming can all have an impact. It's usually multifaceted",1
"Maybe - depends a lot on pretty much every other factor, we'd need more details to say. What program, what calories, what trainee (age, weight, sex, training experience).",1
What are your thoughts on doing only incline bicep curls and hammer curls?,1
"That works. Personally i'd use a bicep machine if that's available,.",1
"Thats fine. Despite a million youtube videos, you really only need a handful of bicep exercises and it looks like you found the specific ones that work well for you.",1
Why do you feel like you need to bounce your pecs? It's douchy,1
"I convinced myself I wasn't going to lift today. I know my body needs the rest. However i then proceeded to have a near 3 hour session (for clarification, its not ego lifting, focused on form, and resting up to 5 minutes between sets). I skipped my last rest day to. Its harder to keep myself out of the gym than going. Is that good or bad? Will i burn out mentally and/or physically?",1
If you enjoy being in the gym and it fits your schedule then it's fine. It's probably unnecessary but life isn't about optimising every little thing. You can always change approach if you find yourself burning out.,1
I question how much you're actually accomplishing in three hours. Even with the five-minute rest periods that's a excessive time to stay in the gym and it's unlikely someone could work out with any sort of intensity for that long.,1
"Maybe there's something else you can do on rest days so you're active, but not lifting. Perhaps bike riding?",1
i dont really know where to post this but im looking to lose so weight before i go on a cruise in about six months i was wondering what advice you guys could give,1
im 6'4 and about 330 lbs idealy i would like to lose 50lbs,1
just wondering if i should lower my expectations,1
General advice is 0.5%-1% body weight per week is reasonable/safe. For obese people that can go up to 2% per week.,1
I would say your goal is very achievable (which should not be mistaken for me saying it will be easy).,1
50 pounds is doable. You got this. If you want to lose weight you must be in a caloric deficit. Add cardio to make the cut even faster,1
2lbs a week of weight loss should be doable at your weight. Please check https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/ for detailed advice on how to achieve that.,1
"More of a nutrition question I think? I just had 2 babies back to back. Trying to do a calorie deficit but when I go to the gym I'm focusing on strength training (some cardio, maybe 15-30 min per session). When I do heavy lifts I AM STARVING. I know some hunger is to be expected but I really don't understand how you don't adjust calories even a bit to accommodate what you burn working out.",1
If I'm doing say 15% deficit and then burning even 200 calories (conservatively) I'm more like 20%+ deficit . Please dumb it down for me,1
Regular weigh-ins will tell you what your energy deficit is by how quickly you are losing weight.,1
"You can't gauge how much you're burning when working out.  The only way to tell is by how fast you're losing weight.  1-2 lbs/week average loss of weight is what you're going to be adjusting for, and changing every few weeks.  Best way to do that is calculate your TDEE and reduce the amount by 500 calories.",1
Brand new to serious training. I'm just beginning my research and have a primary goal of losing 12 pounds of fat as quickly as possible and in a healthy way. (30's Male),1
Any tips would be greatly appreciated. I'm currently looking at 2 fast days/week + 3 hours cardio daily until that 12 pounds melts off.,1
primary goal of losing 12 pounds of fat as quickly as possible and in a healthy way,1
"The wiki explains fat loss, but i'd eat in a 1000 calorie deficit per day, and do full body strength training to minimize muscle loss. Fasting isn't healthy since your body needs nutrients, and 3 hours cardio is overkill.",1
"The wiki would be a great place to start. In short, weight loss if a sustained caloric deficit.",1
"Your approach sounds a bit naff but nothing too crazy - If you feel like fasting and lots of cardio will work for you and you're motivated to do it, just give it a go and see. However if you're going to do 3 hours of cardio a day for the love of god make sure it's low impact. If you go from 0 activity to 3 hours of running a day with no workup you'll absolutely regret it.",1
If it ends up being too tough to stick with long term you can try a more normal approach (ie: just eat a less food).,1
I'd highly recommend tracking your caloric intake and weight to get a handle of your TDEE. There's a huuge selection of very good articles by much smarter people than I over at strongerbyscience / macrofactor that would answer any questions - here's a good primer.,1
"In this video what does he mean when he says to do ""3x8-10""?",1
"Does this mean you do 3x8 the first day, 3x9 the 2nd, then 3x10?",1
"Or do anywhere from 8 to 10 reps (so, preferably 10, but 8 is fine)?",1
That’s a rep range. Pick a weight you can do 3 sets of anywhere from 8-10 reps. If you can do 3 sets of 10 across it’s time to increase the weight.,1
Why would you follow an influencer instead of a fitness coach?,1
You can lift every day. There are 6-7 day programs. It's about managing recovery and fatigue with the volume. High frequency training is nothing new,1
5/3/1 has a conditioning component that makes it an everyday thing. Are you doing that?,1
Please don’t listen to Andrew Tate as a good source of lifting advice lol. But you can work out as often as you want as long as you manage your fatigue and recovery well. A good program like BBB will do that for you.,1
will doing cardio after your lifts hurt your gains?,1
No,1
"That's how I do my cardio, I've never noticed any negatives",1
No. You may need to eat more to compensate for the increased expenditure though.,1
Would y’all do deadlifts the day after working back or should I take a day off in between?,1
I would. I'd even deadlift on consecutive days. The notion that you need 48 hours between training the same muscle doesn't need to be strictly followed.,1
"There are a lot of potential caveats, but in general yes I train deadlift a day after training my back.",1
"Entirely up to you. Deadlifts can even be considered a back exercise, so you might try putting them on your back day.",1
I would.,1
What workout imrpoves the posture?,1
And does those posture correctors improve posture overtime?,1
"Thoracic spine mobility, scapular protraction and retraction exercises, overhead mobility and strength, regular breaks from being in the same posture (ie stand up and move away from your desk every hour for a couple of minutes if you are regularly using a computer).",1
"In addition to what others have posted, I find that dead hangs are great for decompressing your spine.",1
"I found that my posture got corrected when I just started being more physically active. I'd try to get more steps in, as well as some resistance training if you're not already doing some. The wiki has some good routines here. If you're short on equipment, I suggest the r/bodyweighfitness recommended routine. That's how I got my start",1
"YTWs/Blackburns, yoga",1
It depends what's wrong with the posture. Can you be more specific?,1
I don't think those things work.,1
What would you recommend to beginner who wants to gain some weight and to stay in a shape?,1
What kind of workouts are key for a whole body?,1
"Ofcourse, I watched some fitness youtubers but I somehow think they do so many things and I don't know if all of them are necessary.",1
"Keep it simple. Check Wiki as they already said, caloric surplus with quality food and workout mostly with basic and compound movements.",1
I’d recommend they read the wiki,1
Bulking slowly while following a hypertrophy training program (such as in wiki) would let you gain weight without excessive fat gain.,1
https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/ https://thefitness.wiki/routines/,1
r/bodyweightfitness has a great program for calisthenics that also have variations that include weights. Check it out:,1
https://old.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine,1
I'd skip the incline and just press vertically.,1
Your goals seem confusing so I can't offer more advice. I would suggest looking at the Wiki because it's full of wonderful information and useful weight training routines. Having a proven plan can make a world of difference to new trainees and can be the difference between making great progress or just barely making progress.,1
"None of those movements really hit your lateral delts - if you care about that, you may want to consider an overhead press and/or lateral DB raises",1
"I hope this is allowed, I'd really like some input.",1
"I am a 31 year old woman with an unspecified autoimmune issue (in progress of diagnosis). I only mention this to explain my workout needs: I cannot have anything high impact, no jumping, no running. My spine can't handle it. So.. the perfect exercises have been indoor cycling, Pilates occasionally, Barre occasionally, and yoga regularly. I swim in the summer to help with joint issues and build strength.",1
"If I do not maintain yoga and cycling regularly (I missed a week recently and it has me starting from square 1 again; flexibility lost, average RHR lost. I go downhill fast lol), I risk losing a lot of benefits I get from it.",1
Here's my typical plan:,1
"I moderately cycle for 20-30 minutes at minimum three times a week to meet the AHA recommendations. Sometimes my weeks are more like 5-6 rides, sometimes 1 or 2 but over a month or so they typically balance out to that.",1
I do 20-30 minute yoga sessions 4-5 times a week. I usually focus on flexibility and standing balances. This is consistent.,1
"I am now interested in entering Barre into the works. I want more controlled flexibility and the benefit of working muscles. Plus it seems like a fun thing to try again.  What would you change in my current exercise routine, if anything, to add 20-30 minutes of Barre twice a week?",1
"My goal: maintain health. I am in minimal pain when I maintain this, but I want more variety now.",1
If you have the time and the energy then I’d just add in the Barre on top of what you’re doing. If doing so overextends you then pull out some of the yoga (as it’s most similar to Barre).,1
Is +500 overkill and +250 optimal? I remember hearing the second +250 is mostly turned into fat.,1
Depends on your goals and starting point.,1
"If you can really dial in your diet to 250 calories then it's certainly the target to hit, but in my personal view I'd rather take out the error and make sure I'm in a bulk than be tip toeing around maintenance.",1
So +500 you mean actually gaining a pound a week? Yes that is probably too fast for most of us,1
There is no such thing as optimal. If you train hard enough you will get stronger at +500 than at +250 even if it means you get fatter,1
How reliable is an online TDEE calculator?,1
Reliable enough for a starting place. You will always have to adjust intake based on real-world results.,1
It’s a decent first guess,1

"If you have the financial means, r/MacroFactor is an excellent resource",1
How much protein do you take everyday? Please don't say to calculate 0.8g per kg of body weight? Is it healthy to take 90g protein everyday?,1
I don’t take protein I eat it ;),1
I eat over 200 g protein per day.,1
"All relevant lab work (liver function, kidney function) is clean as of my birthday in 2022. I'll have new blood work in 2023 and expect similar results.",1
"for size and strength, yes, you need 1.6-1.8g per kg. that is fully enough. dont listen to others who say u need more.",1
"humans can be considered imperfect when it comes to fitness, hypertrophy, and strength gains:",1
"Limited muscle mass: Humans have a limited capacity for muscle growth compared to other animals. We are not able to build as much muscle mass as some other species, such as gorillas or elephants.",1
Slow muscle recovery: Humans have a relatively slow muscle recovery time compared to other animals. We are not able to recover as quickly from intense physical activity or weightlifting sessions.,1
"Limited flexibility: Humans have a limited range of motion in certain joints, such as the shoulder and hip, which can limit our ability to perform certain exercises or movements.",1
"Limited endurance: Humans have a limited endurance capacity compared to other animals, which can limit our ability to perform high-intensity or long-duration exercises.",1
"Limited resistance to injury: Humans are susceptible to a wide range of injuries, including strains, sprains, and tears, which can limit our ability to perform certain exercises or activities.",1
"Limited response to training: Humans have a limited response to training, meaning that we may not see the same level of strength or muscle gains as other species. Some people may have a harder time to gain muscle mass or strength, due to genetics or other factors.",1
https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/,1
Please don't say to calculate 0.8g per kg of body weight?,1
Why not? That is good advice if you are trying to support muscular hypertrophy.,1
Edit: oops I read that as 0.8 g/lbs,1
Does a neutral grip dumbbell press with your arms close by your side do the same thing (in terms of adding extra emphasis to your triceps) as a close grip BB press?,1
"No, the ROM for close grip bench press can't really be replicated very well with dumbbells. I'd just do isolation exercises with dumbbells like skullcrushers instead if you want to train triceps with dumbbells.",1
I have created a complete home workout routine (using only Barbells and Dumbbells) after ~2 hours of searching (see below).,1
"I haven’t started it yet and am uncertain as to whether it is too extensive for someone who hasn’t worked out seriously in 3yrs, granted I was a semi-pro athlete (100m sprint) and I am still in very good shape with a noticeable amount of muscle, but even at that I did not have a routine as lengthy as this.",1
"I would appreciate any suggested alterations to this routine. Also, my last question is does it matter how I space out each set? E.g. would it be optimal to complete a set in 30mins vs 1 set every 2hrs? Or does that not matter?",1

"Before the pandemic I was 170 and was pretty fit, during the lockdown I went up to 200, completely fat. Over the last year I’ve worked my ass off to get back down to 170. Only thing is that now I’ve have this very stubborn belly fat that I didn’t have when I weighed the same weight pre-pandemic. I have a pretty healthy diet - meals consist mainly of vegetables, fruit, chicken, fish - protein intake is almost at 1g per pound using casein and whey shakes through out the day and I measure a calorie deficit almost on a daily basis. Am I missing any other steps to get rid of the belly fat? Thanks in advance! I appreciate all tips!",1
"Edit: Forgot to mention that I do workout daily, about 45 to 60 minutes for my routine + 30 min of cardio daily. Alcohol consumption is at 1 drink per month.",1
The perceived belly fat could be from bloating due to dietary changes.,1
Have you been lifting? Are you at the same level of fitness as you were?,1
"Remember, muscle is more dense than fat. So you may weigh the same, but you likely have more fat now than musy",1
How long did it take you guys to be able to bounce your pecs?,1
Pretty fast but it's easy to cheat by also kinda using your delt,1
A few months. Practice helps.,1
It’s just mind muscle connection. Build muscle there and you’ll notice it pretty quickly,1
"so if i am supposed to have 2 rir. example: max is 10 reps. session 1: 3x8, s2: 3x9, s3: 3x10(feeling like im close to failure, s4: 3x8. in s4 i drop with reps cause body said so.",1
how do i know when not to add reps and when to add reps if im not training at 0 rir?,1
Linear progression and auto-regulated training are kind of two different ways of going about it.,1
"For a linear progression scheme, you might do your first workout at what you feel is a challenging, but not overly difficult, relative intensity - say you do 3x8 @ 225 for squats, and you feel like that last set you could've gotten somewhere between 11 and 13 reps if a gun was to your head (so 3-5 RIR).",1
"Then you just progressively overload, adding weight to the bar or volume every session according to your progression scheme. One of two things is true - either you'll eventually max out and end up at 0rir, or you'll just never stop getting stronger. Which would be pretty sweet.",1
"Auto-regulated training is different - you actively attempt to hit a certain rating of perceived exertion or number of reps in reserve on each set, according to your program. So the actual number of reps you do in each set might vary depending on your performance. Or you might continue adding weight to the bar on heavy singles/doubles/triples until you reach a max weight for the day, with your decision on that max weight being based on the feel of your past sets.",1
Unfortunately RIR training is something where you just need to learn to listen to your body and feel how each rep goes. Eventually it's something you're able to just do by feel,1
"Hey y’all! I’m going on a one week trip where I won’t be able to train, should I still take creatine considering I started two weeks ago or no?",1

"In the past I got rid of 90%ish of my anxiety/depression symptoms by doing 45m-1h15m of lifting, 6 days a week, after 5 or so weeks of consistency. Sometimes threw 20m stationary bike in.",1
"Compared to the above, what are the anxiolytic effects of walking? How much walking would I need to do to match 45m strength training in terms of anxiolytic benefit?",1
"A 30 minute walk helps a lot for me, especially with sunlight and music. I’d say sometimes it’s better than an equivalent amount of lifting, sometimes not as much.",1
"For me, intensity helps. So if the walk isn’t hitting the spot I’ll do a few minutes of something more intense. Like kettlebell swings, or in a pinch you can just do like 10 burpees when you get home from your walk.",1
Bottom line try it and see!,1
"strength training and cardio are very different forms of exercise and i doubt it's possible to determine an equivalence.  i'm not even sure how to determine the anxiolytic benefit of any individual exercise.  maybe brain scans, i don't know",1
"that said, many times my workout has completely reset my mood, for the better.  doesn't matter if it's strength training or a jog.  even a walk helps a lot.",1
"anyway, my personal experience is that many forms of cardio are relaxing and calming.  there's something almost meditative about walking and jogging....  the rhythms of your breathing, your heartbeat, your feet on the pavement.",1

Sit up tall and set the seat high so your hands are below your nipples in the bottom position, keep your elbows close to your ribs with a narrow grip (not flared), push hard through the base of your palm until your arms are nearly fully extended. It might help to imagine you're pushing yourself back into the seat.",1
"Think of the movement as your upper arms moving forward and tracking the curve of your ribcage. Don't go heavy to start with or you'll lose the form, you want to have about 5 reps left in you at the end of the first set, do 5 sets of 10. You might not feel it in the first workout but over a couple of week it should help.",1

I smoke daily and in great shape. I generally smoke before runs as well and have no issues. Definitely not optimal but if you train long enough it doesn’t really bother you.,1
The bug issue is getting high on a cut. Then I have to use all the will I can muster not to snack at night.,1
"What are some good core exercising for somebody, such as myself, with a very weak core?",1
"My core is so weak that I can't even do one rep of a lot of the common core exercises. When I do planks, I feel the burn in my upper arms and shoulders, not my core. I have separate exercises for those areas. This could be a form problem.",1
Balance exercises don't work either because I don't have good enough balance (yet) to complete any of the common exercises,1
"What I've come up with is crunches and knee planks. I don't even think I'm doing these correctly, however. With crunches, I feel like I'm just flopping around on the floor with little benefit. With knee planks, the limiting factor seems to be my arms instead of my core.",1
Any ideas?,1
"Pallof presses, medicine ball slams and throws, wood chops.",1
Z presses with an empty barbell or light dumbbells/kettlebells,1
"dead bugs are great for this. There are regressions and progressions posted online, and the form is pretty simple and hard to mess up.",1
with a very weak core?,1
"When I do planks, I feel the burn in my upper arms and shoulders, not my core.",1
I suggest perhaps revisiting the logic you're using to form a conclusion from the available evidence.,1
"When performing an exercise with multiple components, do you expect your strongest or your weakest muscles (relative to each other and the movement) to give out first?",1
Does anyone know any good home workout fitness program for beginners that improves lower back pain?,1
"I could of course just google and all but the results are a lot and I just don't know where to begin. I am 5""2 and weigh 57kg",1
"I had a sedentary lifestyle for a while now and my back started acting out a few months ago. Now that my schedule had improved, I plan to start doing home workouts to help with my LBP",1
the r/bodyweightfitness program is doable with minimal equipment and works your whole body.  a reverse nordic curl progression or a glute bridge progression are their choices for the posterior chain.  Best thing to do would be deadlifts witch require a barbell and weight.,1
"McGill Big 3: side planks, bird dogs, curl-ups.",1
Beyond that IME anything that makes your lower back stronger is good for lower back pain.  Heavy squats and deadlifts changed my life.,1
"But ""lower back pain"" covers a broad range of potential causes and severity.  If it's generalized low back pain that is just a symptom of tightness and weakness in the affected and surrounding musculature, strength training is a great tool to address it.  But low back pain can also be a symptom of many other serious conditions, so ultimately this treads into Rule #5 and you should talk to your doctor.",1
"The bench press is a compound move. The first thing to give out between your shoulders, triceps, and chest is going to have the highest level of fatigue. Sometimes, that's your shoulders. Doesn't mean the exercise is bad, or not working.",1
Also note that the mind-muscle connection and feeling of burn/tension in a compound exercise is not something most trainees are particularly adept at.,1
"All of this is a fancy way of saying - don't worry about it, it's working your chest just fine. Don't overthink it, keep doing it and getting stronger.",1
"I can still do the benches past it, but it feels like my shoulders are getting worked instead.",1
What could be the problem here?,1
There is no problem. Working your shoulders is part of doing the bench press.,1
"In a workout session, is it better to do all sets of an excercise with the same weight or should it be increased progressively?",1
For example barbell bench press.,1
70kg x 8reps x 3 sets,1
or,1
50kg x 8reps x 1 set,1
60kg x 8reps x 1 set,1
70kg x 8reps x 1 set,1
I get that total weight lifted is higher in the first example. But I sometimes feel uncomfortable doing the heavyest weights 'cold' and I feel more in control if I start out with the lower weights. Is it just me and I should get over it? I've seen many people increase their weights between sets.,1
https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/,1
Use a program. They all handle that.,1
"So long as you're doing some warm-up sets, you should do whatever the program tells you to do for your working sets.",1
"do you not do warmup sets? You shouldn't be starting ""cold"". That's probably what you are seeing people do.",1

How accurate is the calories burned on a fit bit (I have the charge 5) and should I use the value given as a baseline for determining my caloric needs for cutting and bulking?,1
https://macrofactorapp.com/wearables/,1
"Generally speaking, not accurate at all.",1
That doesn't mean your FitBit isn't accurate for you.,1
"Get a rough baseline TDEE, track your calories, track your weight over time.  That's how you calculate the ""out"" side of CICO.  It may turn out that your FitBit is spot on.  It might be dramatically wrong.",1
They aren't.,1
"You could use it as a starting point for bulk/cut, but I wouldn't rely on it as tracking how much you burned each day individually because it's not THAT accurate (nothing is).",1
"I’m at 144-ish lbs at 5’5 rn. Ive been bulking and have gotten a little fluffy but I’m kinda worried about a cut. I’m afraid I’ll be real skinny if I go on a cut, even though most of it is on my abs and legs. Should I go on a cut or do a recomp? My whole worry is getting stuck in a halfway point right around beach time.",1
You could cut now and get lean and then maintain (recomp) through summer.,1
"You likely won't be real skinny if you've been working out hard during your bulk. Sounds like you're new at this... so maybe not a whole lot of muscle mass built up, but should be some. Plus, if you're feeling fluffy, it's good to cut down. Could easily lose 10lbs. 15lbs may put you in a better spot.  (i'm 2 inches taller - and a woman - and 135 is my easy to maintain lean spot, 130 would be very lean, but i'll probably drop that low this summer in an attempt to find abs).",1
"If you were to lose 1lb a week, 15 weeks would put you at the start of May, then you can maintain through all of summer and be beach bod ready.",1

Because bodies. Whether or not you feel a muscle has nothing to do with whether or not it's working.,1
Why do I burn more calories than my friend when we do the exact same workout/workout classes?,1
"Is your friend the same height, weight, BMI, dna as you?",1
"If those numbers come from fitness watches, they’re usually calculated from body size and heart rate. Both of these vary a lot from person to person, of course.",1
"If you are using a heart rate based device to calculate calories burned, you should be pretty skeptical of the number it gives you, such that you couldn't really know who is burning more calories.",1
"But given the same activity, a larger person will typically burn more calories.",1
Why do you think anything that claims to measure calories burns is even vaguely accurate? They aren't.,1
I'm looking to buy a pre-workout online but all of them are underdosed. Can I but L-Citrulline  and caffeine separately and use that instead?,1
"Yeah. I just mix citrulline, beetroot powder, and Gatorade, then use it to toss back some caffeine pills. Buy in bulk. Cost per servings is way cheaper than what you’ll spend on tubs of pre over time.",1
"Can someone explain to me why my legs keep growing even tho I haven’t trained them for nearly two years? Even tho I’m cutting now they’re getting bigger rather quickly. My legs are my strong point, but this doesn’t make sense",1

How are you determining that they are getting bigger? Are you measuring your legs? How rapidly are you losing weight? What is your current weight/height?,1
"How do guy folks warm up for heavy squats? I really want to get my numbers up, but I hate squats and they make me tired as heck.",1

"On my 2nd week of lifting after a multi year hiatus. First time lifting without the guidance of a team sports coach though. Following the basic A+B workout plan on the wiki. I've started to get a really tight left hip flexor that really inhibited my squats today. I've been trying to stretch it since I noticed it about a week ago, but it just seems to get worse every time.",1
"Should I just keep stretching and stick to the schedule and hope it gets better, or do I need to take a break from squats until I deal with it?",1
"My personal rule around issues like this is to not do lifts that are causing me pain/problems.  I don't even do squats or deadlifts anymore because they hurt my lower back too much.  Instead of squats/deads, I just do elliptical work (forwards/backwards with and without the arm levers), walking lunges without weight, glute bridge walkout without weight, and seated machine hamstring curls.",1
"That being said, I'm 50 years old and definitely need to be cautious in regards to lifting due to injuries not healing quickly at my age.  Also, I was blessed with good lower body genetics and am fine with my lower body at it's current size, so cutting out squats/deads was a fairly easy decision for me.",1
"I watch a lot of Youtube fitness videos and Mike Israetel of Renaissance Periodization (fairly popular Youtuber with a ton of resistance-related videos) just came out with a video today saying that doing the big 3 (squats, deads, bench) is not necessary if they are not working for you.",1
"Before you read this, it may sound stupid. I am just trying to gain an understanding of something. How come for some powerlifting routines you are supposed to do (for example) tricep work and upper back work on a squat day? Is it so that you are working your muscles for the next time you are going to bench instead of doing them on bench day? I have been working out for a year and a half and only really have used ppl / arnold splits. Thanks!",1
It just spreads the volume out throughout the week. Some programs choose to do that and others do not,1
Where do you all get your workout programs?,1
"In addition to what cat said, I also like this when I'm thinking about new things to try https://thefitness.wiki/intermediate-advanced-resources/program-review-archive/",1

Trying to better my diet for recovery. For snacks at work I would eat granola bars.  These are too much of a carbs snack. They have too many carbs I feel and make you hungrier. What's a good replacement nuts?,1
Depends on what you mean by better your diet.,1
They have too many carbs I feel and make you hungrier.,1
It's very possible that they are doing this!,1
What's a good replacement nuts?,1
"What's your goal? If you are trying to keep calories low, nuts can add up VERY quickly. BUT they are quite satiating and I'll have a serving of nuts as a snack quite frequently. However, if I was cutting, I wouldn't do this as often.",1
"Boiled eggs are another good snack, but due to the fat in the yolks, can also add up in calories quite quick. But good protein amount. I also find these very satiating.",1
A standard block of low-moisture mozzarella  (or string cheese) can be another good fat/protein snack.,1
"But another option all together is to address what you're eating for lunch (or breakfast, whichever you're eating before wanting this snack) and see what changes you can make there to keep you fuller and more satiated longer.",1
"But with whatever option, try drinking a glass of water before grabbing a snack. It could be you're not hydrating enough! I try and drink about a gallon of water a day at a minimum. Sounds like a lot, but it's really not!",1
Stop being lazy.,1
See a mental health professional. I got nothing for someone who calls themselves too mentally ill and lazy to eat more.,1
Snack Time: what are your go to high protein low calorie snacks?,1
"I love chips and I'm dying for something crunchy and savory, but chips dont fit my macros anymore.",1
if you have an air fryer then you can make some awesome crunchy chicken tenders extremely easily. They would be almost entirely protein and just a little carbs for the breading.,1
"Do you have a recipe anywhere for this? Would love to try it, I'm no chef so it sounds perfect.",1
"sure thing, Im a terrible cook and this is incredibly easy even for me",1
Ingredients-,1
Chicken Tenders (precut or cut your own),1
Flour,1
Eggs,1
"Corn Flakes (you can choose anything you want for breading but I think this is the best for crunch, texture, color, and flavor. Just buy a box of regular Corn Flakes and blend them up into small pieces)",1
Seasoning of choice (I just put some cajun seasoning in the breading bowl),1
Directions -,1
Just a simple 3 step breading process.,1
"Get 3 bowls. 1 for flour, 1 for eggs, 1 for breading.",1
Dip chicken in flour bowl,1
Dip chicken in egg bowl,1
Dip chicken in breading bowl,1
Place the breaded tender onto a sheet of parchment paper or something until you are finished w/ all of them,1
"Place in air fryer, spray 1 side of the chicken with some kind of oil, flip over, spray other side",1
"Cook at 380 for ~6-7 mins, flipping halfway through",1
Thats it! You will not believe how crunchy and delicious these are!,1
Heres the video I followed for this recipe - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SeM_eo3yE,1
crunchy and savory,1
would a pickle fit? I munch a lot of pickles when I'm cutting,1
Protein pudding.,1
"~175g greek yoghurt (0%, 2%, 5% mf are all fine)",1
~15g pb powder,1
~10g honey,1
Anywhere from 1/2 to 1 scoop protein powder (I use this),1
"Unroasted cashews do the trick for me, plus my jaw gets tired pretty quickly. Has good fats and decent protein too. There is also popcorn.",1
I've been eating a lot of wasa crispbread lately. They're the right crispy crunch (as opposed to a wet crunch like vegetables). Pretty meh on their own but they're the perfect vehicle for thick dips and toppings. Very satisfying.,1
Celery dipped in peanut butter?,1
Parmesan crisps aren’t really low cal but they are high protein and delicious. I get the ones at Trader Joe’s.,1
trader Joe's fake spicy pork rinds.,1
"Nuts are a good replacement for chips along some dimensions, esp. crunchiness- high calorie but more of it is fat and protein, compared to chips. You may be able to eat less of them more easily too, which would help you hit your calorie goals. They feel more filling than chips.",1
"I signed up for a personal trainer through a chain gym in the US (crunch) and so far I’m less than impressed, I told her my goals (lose fat, gain muscle) she gave me a daily calorie goal of 2750. The issue here is that before I signed up I told her I mainly wanted nutrition help, we meet once a week to do a HIIT which I don’t mind at all but she’s yet to send me a full diet plan and it feels like I’m doing everything myself. I’m gonna talk to her this upcoming week and either cancel or hopefully get switched to someone else. Does anyone have a positive experience from a personal trainer in a gym? Or am I expecting too much",1
EDIT: I should say that I asked the gym manager and there was a list of top 3 trainers that specialize in nutrition and she was one of them,1
A personal trainer at a commercial place is basically unqualified to provide any advice you can't find in the Wiki.,1
"It sounds like you need to talk to your trainer and outline your exact wants. If they're not delivering on that, why pay them?",1
And even sometimes advice you can find in the wiki,1
Absolutely agree,1
You’re expecting too much. Hopefully they won’t charge you any cancellation fee..,1
Why would you ask a trainer for nutrition advice? Would you be as upset if you went to a nutritionist and they didn't give you a detailed exercise plan?,1
"I didn’t say it in the post but the trainer specializes in nutrition, it was one of the things that made me want to sign up with them",1
"I’ve never been super impressed with a trainer but that’s just my experience. Idk what you’re paying her, but an app like MacroFactor would most likely be cheaper and more reliable. I have similar goals to yours and it’s been phenomenal for me.",1
"Honestly, if you're looking for nutrition advice, a trainer isn't it.",1
"I have a trainer (he trains from his home gym) and he's absolutely fantastic. We've talked nutrition/diet to a degree, but only scratch the surface. Mostly just around making sure to eat plenty of protein, and then rough calorie estimate to cut on and then his experiences with diet and such back when he was a body builder.",1
"I would never expect him to tell me exactly what to eat. Plus, what I like is different than what he likes. So if he laid out a diet plan that said eat a can of tuna with breakfast or something and if I didn't like tuna... I'd either follow the plan and be miserable, or not follow the plan. So in short, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a spelled out diet plan that you fully like.",1
"Instead, I'd say do your own research and experimentation.  You need to find what works best for YOU. If you are overweight and you want to lose fat, you need to be in a calorie deficit. So eat fewer calories than you burn. You could technically do this eating nothing but pizza, but you will be miserable and hungry. You need to hit a protein goal (roughly .8-1g of protein per pound of body weight, if you're over weight, use your goal weight). You need a minimal number of fats to be healthy but if you eat a varied diet and don't avoid fat, you're fine here. Carbs are the least important, but eat plenty of veggies and fruits for fiber and micronutrients. Beyond that, it's count your calories.",1
"If you are NOT overweight and are already lean, but have like a belly pouch, you may fall more into skinnyfat. If this is the case, you need to build up muscle first (so eating in a slight surplus) and then later diet back down to a lean weight.",1
"There an easy way to tell if something is DOMS or something worse?  Started deadlifting and squats (low bar if it matters) about a week ago.  I've done them before but without any sort of consistency and with horrible form.  Last part of last year was me doing a ton of them with an empty/light bar trying to get my form straightened out.  That done I've started adding real weight to the bar for about a week.  My sets leave me out of breath but it takes less than a minute to catch my breath and I feel worn out by the end which seems normal.  I've developed a soreness in my lower back right above my waist.  Makes it hurt more when I try to run.  Not sure if DOMs since this is week 1 of the ""new year, new me"" thing or if I've already severely injured myself.",1
Simple philosophy:,1
If it hurts when you move it but not when you sit still: it's DOMS.,1
If it hurts when you sit still: it's an injury.,1
I agree but specifically for DL I do feel DOMS as a general soreness in my lower back (more like on my tail bone) that is there even when not moving.,1
I'd be concerned about that myself.,1
DOMS usually get (temporarily) better when you move and use the muscle.,1
"You almost certainly haven't severely injured yourself. If it were a serious injury, you wouldn't be asking the internet because you are unsure.",1
Give it a few days off and see how you feel. And make sure you are bracing properly when you lift.,1
"Can anyone help me or link me to an easy fitness routine for my parents? They're 54 and 65 and both quite overweight, have back, knee pains all the time and other than work around the house they just lay in bed or on the couch all day, but especially mom (54) has trouble and pain getting up and is always stiff and develops a hunchback.",1
"Their diet is really poor, eating a lot of pork, white bread and fried stuff and there's nothing I can say about this to change their mind, but they seem willing to try some fitness if I do it with them. Looking just for stuff that can be done at home, without equipment.",1
"Honestly, just go for a walk with them.  An hour of walking will cover 2.5-3 miles and probably get more bang for their buck than bodyweight exercises.  Plus, you get to spend an hour talking w/your parents who you clearly very much care about.",1
"Daily walking is an easy first step. Every day, regardless of weather. Hopefully occasionally increasing distance, speed, or both. For people that are older and over weight, it can make a huge difference in how they feel. Right after lunch is a really good, easy habit to get into.",1
"Diet would be the biggest thing to minimize or even eliminate their aches and pain, but I’m not going to pretend convincing your parents to do stuff doesn’t tend to feel like a lesson in futility.",1
Simple answer is going on walks every day. Also try this for the back,1

Why do you think it's better than any of the recommended routines?,1
Stock response:,1
"Every program needs to balance exercise selection, volume, load, intensity, accumulation, progression, and so on in order to present stimulus while simultaneously managing fatigue.",1
"This makes it sound WAY, WAY more complicated than it actually is, but it is something that can be, and is, fucked up.",1
Beginners have a common set of characteristics that have an effect on how one plans for these variables. One of them is that beginners reliably grow muscle and progress in strength at a prodigious rate from a laughably low amount of volume. Another is that they can only really handle a laughably low amount of volume.,1
"And truly, the only thing more reliable than beginner progression is beginners burning themselves the fuck out. They do so in a variety of incredibly predictable ways (often combining several), which include:",1
Setting too much exercises/volume on day 1 (usually by picking a bad program or creating one themselves),1
Setting too high a relative intensity on day 1 by selecting too high a starting load,1
Progressing in load/volume too quickly,1
"Worrying about what might eventually fuck up their progress or what lagging body part might be left behind, and so trying to add in something to combat every potential issue, thus ending up with endless amounts of fruitless work",1
"The recommended routines are all recommended because they have proven themselves to have a good tuning to all of the variables mentioned. Often, they also have guardrails set up to keep beginners from fucking up a good thing (looking specifically at 5/3/1 here).",1
"I’m in pretty much the exact same spot as OP and I came to this thread looking for protein recommendations as I look to get back to the gym after taking a long hiatus. Just wanted to say thanks- feel like your comment was what I needed to read to avoid burning out for the millionth time as I keep going to the gym, burning out, taking lengthy time off, rinse and repeat. I think I gotta walk it back a bit and didn’t realize. Anyway thanks I needed that reality check.",1
Cheers,1
Everything seems fine except your lifting. I’d pick a program from the wiki that fits your schedule and do exactly what it says,1
no mention of dietary gameplan here (ie. either cut hard and enter a slow disciplined gaining phase after or a slow sustainable cut where you can build plenty of muscle along the way).,1
preparation is your friend ie. meal prep so you don’t just make whatever your hunger brain wants you to make at any given moment.,1
general caloric target with somewhere over 0.7g/lb of protein.,1
since the cardio itself will probably have more of an impact on appetite regulation and heart health vs fat loss if you are not in a deficit.,1
also the cardio before the weights might take your energy away to a small but noticeable extent that will drain your performance and thus your muscle building.,1
"Apologies, should have added my dietary plan here as well. I am doing a slow cut, I have no desire to drop a crazy amount of weight super fast. I eat at a 500 calorie deficit and don’t believe in cutting carbs or any of that. I want this to be sustainable.",1
"Noted on the cardio, I will shift that to post lifting. Appreciate the advice.",1
whats a good back and shoulder superset and where would you put it in your workout?,1
"Clean each rep before pressing it.  I'd make it the primary lift, or work it in a circuit like this",1
I don't add random supersets into my workout.,1
based on the program I'm following I look if there are exercises scheduled for the same day with similar/nearby equipment that I can do as a superset. Then I may do that as a superset,1
"Supersets are a time saving device on top of standard exercise selection and programming, which should come first",1
Yesterday I superset bench shrugs and snatch grip lat shrugs at the end of my workout.,1
"Btw for your question about school lunches, check the archives at r/eatcheapandhealthy",1
What do you already do on your back day?,1
"I rarely feel sore in my back, and I’m wondering does that mean I’m not working hard enough? I’m going to failure a lot.",1
"As long as you are seeing progression you are doing enough. Soreness isn't a good indicator of a good workout, rather that you did a movement your body isn't accustomed to.",1
What lifting routine are you following?,1
"If you don't have one, consider one from the wiki. I trust them to give me enough work.",1
I thrust them,1
🤤,1
There are many great PPL routines already by experts. I would choose one and follow it.,1

Biceps weekly sets question: So 12-20 weekly sets per muscle group is recommended for optimum muscle growth. Do compounds such as rows or pull downs count as bicep sets or do only curls count towards those weekly sets?,1

"I like backpacking/hiking. Last time I went backpacking at the end of the second day of 10 mile hikes my left knee felt unstable. It didn't hurt, it just felt unsupported.",1
It was fine with about a week of rest after the trip.,1
I usually do powerlifting lifts/some running for exercise to prepare for these trips.,1
I have a longer trip in a few months that will be miserable if my knee hurts the whole time.,1
What are some good exercises to improve knee support/stability?,1
"I’ve done a fair bit of lifting and a fair bit of backpacking (longest stretch was 90 miles in 5 days on the AT). I honestly don’t notice much carryover. I’m sure there is some, but it’s hard to pinpoint.",1
"Going on hikes, especially ones on rough terrain with lots of scrambling, loose rocks, etc. will probably be the most helpful. Just start out slow and work your way up.",1
"Squats, deadlifts, calf raises, single leg rdls, Bulgarian split squats, platz squats. Basically you just need to increase the amount of muscle mass supporting your knees, if you only have a few months it might be too little too late but you might as well start now",1
"I've experienced great synergy between running in general, hill running, hiking, and lifting. For the lifting, I've found whole body lifting helpful (as opposed to just legs, though squats are great) for hiking as having greater overall strength helps with moving while carrying weight, and with balance.",1
Sounds like a heavy backpack or heavy boots issue. Head over to r/ultralight to figure out what you need to.,1
"Strength helps too, and you got good tips for that - I'll add that ankle and foot stuff can help too, as we're not used to walking on uneven ground and our feet and ankles don't know how to work it and you just get a lot of torque on the knees. Balance board, pick up things with your foot, and so forth.",1
Do you hike on a regular basis? I would say hiking or rucking would be the best training for backpacking. Practice like you play.,1
Does diet soda/zero calorie beverages hydrate you as well as water?  How about black coffee?,1
Yes they do hydrate you about the same as water - I'm not sure why the others think otherwise. The diuretic effect of caffeine is overexaggerated.,1
Here's some credence:,1
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25154702/,1
Caffeine exerted a minor diuretic effect which was negated by exercise. Concerns regarding unwanted fluid loss associated with caffeine consumption are unwarranted particularly when ingestion precedes exercise.,1
They’re mostly water. Any diuretic effect from the caffeine will not be strong enough to outpace the amount of water you’re consuming by drinking them.,1
"Yes, so does coffee. Caffeine just makes you pee more often, that’s why the myth of dehydration is a thing",1
Do collagen peptides actually do anything?,1
"I've read extensive anecdotal accounts that it helps keep our skin from thinning as we age, but most scientific research i've read says we dont really absorb any of it and it just gets pooped out.",1
https://examine.com/supplements/type-ii-collagen/,1
Doesn't look like there's much research aside from improvements for arthritis related ailments.,1
"Not really. Your body makes collagen on its own and will just break it down into its base amino acids in your stomach anyway. No guarantee it’s being used for what you want, and you probably get a good bit of it from your diet anyway if you consome meat/dairy",1
"There is research showing they do get absorbed intact, at least sometimes. But so far I’m not aware of any robust evidence on outcomes.",1
I DONT sweat that much during workout. Do i need to take a quick shower before sauna/steam that is in the gym? Can I just walk in after my workout?,1
I like to stay there for maybe 5-7 minutes before taking a proper shower afterwards.,1
This seems like a question you should ask the employees at the gym.,1
"Unless your gym has a policy about showering before use, just use your best judgment. It’s a room full of sweaty dudes. I doubt you’d stink bad enough for it to be an issue.",1
How can I (F25) shorten leg day? I do this routine 2-3x a week (plus upper body & cardio 2-3 days) and it takes almost 4 hours sometimes. I know that's too long but I don't know the best way to shrink it down! Here is the routine below:,1
"BB back squat 125lb 12x5, 135lb 8x3, 145lb 8x5 BB front squat 95lb 10x4 BB RDL 135lb 13x4, 155lb 8x4 Pistol squat 10lb 20x3, 20lb 30x3, 30lb 15x3 Hip thrust 1plate 12x5 2plates 10x5 Leg press 10x5 Leg extension 12x5 with drop sets DB RDL 50lbs 15x5 1 leg hip thrust 12x4 (superset w above)",1
"(There's a bunch of exercises I can't do because of hip problems, like split squats, lunges, conventional deadlift, single leg deadlift, Bulgarian split squats, etc)",1
Thank you have a wonderful day :),1
it takes almost 4 hours sometimes.,1
I think for a beginner/intermediate you are doing way too much and you should scale it back by a lot.,1
There's a lot of programs in the wiki that are good.,1
"You are doing 13 sets of squats. Why? That is not necessary. If you are working hard in each set, everything after set 5 or 6 is going to be junk.",1
You have a total of 63 sets. That is absolutely absurd. No one is training effectively for 63 sets. I can get a good hard leg day in doing about 12 sets.,1
Don't try to fix this routine. Just throw it out. It is a ridiculous routine that no one should follow. Just pick a routine from the wiki or any other respected programs.,1
"Agh i know, I got into this by trying to make each workout better than the last, which was like ""oh I can do one more set"" and then it all added up.",1
"I seem to need a lot of ""warm up"" squat sets of lower weights to slowly build up to my heaviest one. Partly because of my hip stuff, since my form is kinda wonky.",1
I've been working out like this for so long honestly I'm scared to reduce it. For years my workouts have taken me 2 - 4 hours and if I do any less it just doesn't feel like enough,1
It helps to have other people confirming that I don't need to do this much 😅,1
More sets doesn't mean better. I would say anything past 25 total sets in a day and you are probably doing a bunch of junk volume (not counting warmup sets). Personally I think 2 hours is too much. Get on a proper program. Most programs can be finished in 1 to 1.5 hours.,1
"Warmup sets can be done quickly. You do a set, reload the weight, then do another set. I normally do 3-5 warmup sets for squats  but it takes less than 10 minutes to get through.",1
Okay thank you for your insight!!,1
"Agh i know, I got into this by trying to make each workout better than the last, which was like ""oh I can do one more set"" and then it all added up.",1
"Can I suggest you follow something like 5/3/1 for a couple of training blocks? The last main set is an AMRAP (as many reps as possible) with a set weight, and each week the weight gets a tad heavier. This means that you have one set to go all out and try to beat yourself, either by getting more reps than you did previously, or by doing the same amount of reps with more weight.",1
"531 is a program that I didn't particularly enjoy, but the AMRAP aspect of it was really great for me",1
"I'll be honest, if you're doing this much work, I wonder how hard you're pushing in each of your sets.",1
"At the most, my leg days consist of a squat, a hinge, a quad isolation, a leg curl and sometimes some calf raises for a total of ~15-20 sets. That's like, a third of the work you have here, but that's all it takes for me to have a solid leg day.",1
"I'll echo what others have suggested to follow a program from the wiki, but also suggest that you spend some time figuring out what failure feels like to you so that you can work closer to it. It's generally recommended that, for hypertrophy purposes, you keep most of your sets 1-3 reps away from failure.",1
If you really like the idea of adding sets to increase volume look at the rp bodybuilding templates or JuggernautAI for more powerlifting/powerbuilding focus.,1
How can I (F25) shorten leg day?,1
Don't do 28 sets of just back squats.,1
You are doing 30 sets of legs. I can SSB squat in the 500s and am on drugs. My max recoverable volume is 15 sets a week. You are doing 30 3xweek. This is absurd.,1
This is why beginners should not be making their own programs. This is so far off base with reality. Go on the wiki or Boostcamp or lift vault. And pick a program made by a respectable coach and run that.,1
"You've got 185 sets here, plus some drop sets? I noticed some are superset, but that's just a lot lot of sets.",1
"If everything was superset, with 60second rests, this would still likely be 2 hours.",1
May I ask who wrote the program?,1
Consider only doing the first 4 lifts? That's still over 60 sets. Maybe only like 5-10 sets of pistol squats too? You're doing like 65 sets just of that?,1
"Edit: if you've written it as reps x sets, ignore all that. Consider making your rest periods short and strict. 30-60 seconds. I use a timer, it keeps me more honest. Consider specifying reps x sets or sets x reps next time.",1
I think they've written reps x sets instead of sets x reps... Somewhat common in this thread,1
"That makes much more sense. I was like ""wtf, of course it takes four hours, how can you even walk after this?""",1
Sorry the first number is the reps and second is sets 😅,1
"Unfortunately I made this up, it's moreso a plan I made a while ago that morphed into more and more. I'm kind of stuck on the ""more is better"" mindset, which I know is not the way. I just have trouble seeing how reducing my volume would help me see more results",1
I just have trouble seeing how reducing my volume would help me see more results,1
There's an easy solution to that!,1
"Pick a good, reputable program.  One from the wiki would work fine, but there are plenty others.",1
Run it for a few months.,1
Compare your results to what you're doing now.,1
"Simplest answer to your problem is more weight, fewer reps and sets.",1
"I did update my comment. Consider stricter, shorter rest times. My leg days are also about 16-30 total working sets.",1
"Look through some routines in the wiki, and consider either modeling yours off of them, or just grabbing one and running that.",1
why are you doing so many sets of squats,1
If you want a simple and effective leg day I would look into some of John Meadows programs,1
"Who are some solid fitness youtubers to follow, i like sciency based influencers like jeff nippard and sean nalewanyj",1
Stronger by science.,1
I like Renaissance Periodization,1
This right here. Imo Renaissance periodization has everything that most people need to know about lifting.,1
Everything a bodybuilder or bodybuilder-adjacent lifter needs to know,1
Definitely! Good specification!,1

How do you guys keep eating enough protein. I used to be consistent with eating enough protein but now when i have stressful days to deal with i just weightlift without eating enough protein and I even eat less than my calorie intake.,1
Eating enough protein can be hard. That's why we drink protein :D,1
"Provided it fits in with your macros, protein shakes are literally for those who can't eat enough protein.",1
"It gets easier if you build something like a base of high protein foods that you eat everyday, no matter what.",1
"For me, it's achieved eating ""Magerquark"" (I couldn't find the translation for this as curd cheese with low fat didn't seem appropriate, probably think of it as something like Skyr) and drinking a protein shake, additionally to my normal diet that varies.",1
Protein is a priority and I treat it as such. It's the staple of every meal and I pick high protein foods for snacks.,1
"If I'm struggling to hit my target (200+ g/day), then I have a protein shake.",1
Question on changing a 6-day PPL,1
"I'm doing a 6-day PPL routine. It's been a few months, so I read that I have to change. Quick questions below:",1
"Do I need to change the whole PPL structure, OR is it ok to just change the exercises based on what's available in the gym?",1
"If I need to only change the exercises, how do I choose? I know which exercises are more-or-less replacements, but what is the order? I can tell that large muscles and compound exercises are usually first, but what about different muscle groups? For example, one of my current push days goes: a. flat bench, b. seated barbell press (which I changed to dbells, don't ask), c.flat bench close grip, d. flat bench dbell fly, e. standing lateral dbell raise, f. finish with max diamond pushup. It seems to go chest, shoulders, chest (triceps emphasized), chest, shoulder, chest (triceps emphasized). In addition to going from compound-large muscle - small muscle, do I also need to switch muscle groups every exercise? Kind of hard on pull days.",1
"I see that my pull days have bent-over rows and half deadlifts, while leg days have regular deadlifts and good mornings. Considering pull days are followed by leg days, that's too pressure on my much lower back. What am I missing?",1
"Finally, about schedule. I do this 6-day split on 5 days a week. Due to my schedule, I can do weeknights, and nothing on the weekends. So my off days are saturday-sunday. Can't do thusday-sunday. Can you think of another, better split for my case? I'd prefer it be a PPL; that seems to work for me.",1
"I'm doing a 6-day PPL routine. It's been a few months, so I read that I have to change.",1
Are you running a program? Has your progression plateaued?,1
"Do I need to change the whole PPL structure, OR is it ok to just change the exercises based on what's available in the gym?",1
"If you want to get some variety, just change the exercises. If you are starting to plataeu with whatever progression you use, switch to another program.",1
"If I need to only change the exercises, how do I choose? I know which exercises are more-or-less replacements, but what is the order?

In addition to going from compound-large muscle - small muscle, do I also need to switch muscle groups every exercise? Kind of hard on pull days.",1
"Are you into bodybuilding? Powerlifting? If you are doing it for strength gains, don't sweat the accessory exercises.",1
"You could do: Bench press, Arnold press, triceps extensions, Incline db press, front db raises for example.",1
"I see that my pull days have bent-over rows and half deadlifts, while leg days have regular deadlifts and good mornings. Considering pull days are followed by leg days, that's too pressure on my much lower back. What am I missing?",1
A rest day between those days.,1
5 days on 2 days off doesn't work well with PPL in my opinion.,1
Are weighted crunches really bad for you and not the best an exercise if you had to pick just one ab exercise? I really like them because they are easy to feel and progressively overload.,1
"Also, do strength gains from crunches carry over to ab wheel rollouts? I am unable to do these at the moment.",1
They are not bad for you,1
I do not find that they carry over to the ab wheel,1
Do you have a better ab exercise that is easy to overload you could recommend?,1
I do not.  I don't employ overloading in my ab exercises.  I just do 20 standing ab wheels a day and call it good.,1
Is there a reason why you don't?,1
I don't need to.,1
"Sorry I guess I'm just curious why someone wouldn't progressively overload core. Have you done so in the past, right? If so how did you decide/know your core was now strong enough?",1
"Again: I don't need to do it.  20 standing ab wheels a day is enough training for me to continue to get stronger.  If I reach a point where my torso strength becomes the limiter in me achieving my goals, I can work toward that.",1
"You can progressively overload with an ab wheel. Set yourself up in front of a wall or other object. Use a tape measure to know how far your knees (or feet, when you get to standing rollouts) are from that object or wall. You can progressively overload by changing the reps and the range of motion you're using. The wall or object will give you tactile feedback for when you're actually completing a measurable rep.",1
Cable crunch,1
Thanks. Unfortunately I have a home gym so need to stick with something using dumbbells preferably.,1
Hanging leg raises.,1
Inclined crunches w/ heavy db or plates,1
"One of the advantages of ab wheels and planks I've read is that unlike the other muscles in your body, the job of the abs is not to move things, but rather to provide a solid platform that holds the spine stable. Proper bracing is critical for any physical activity. As such with planks and ab wheels you're practicing the actual exercise you want to do.",1
You may be able to do ab wheels while rolling out not as far. Or start with planks. Here's a good video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJyes0rOVPk,1
"I just found out that I can naturally put more then 10kg of muscle, while being on a bulk (21,7% bf). Been training for 2 years. How should I start my cutting phase in terms of food pre and post workout, cardio and lifting and how do I manage to get more muscle mass?",1
Here's a weightroom post about programming for a cut. There's lots of good resources there.,1
"you're not going to get more muscle mass on a cut, you'll just lose fat.  just eat at a deficit with 1.6g/kg protein and lift.  cardio is always good.",1
"Stomach vacuums sound simple in theory, but nobody explains this one step properly anywhere. When you pull in your bellybutton after breathing out, are you supposed to hold your breath when sucking in? Because I can suck in my stomach way more but I feel light headed after. Or am I supposed to pull it in without holding breath and breathe normally? I can get a way stronger contraction while holding breath. It’s so confusing",1
are you talking about bracing?,1
I have no idea of the phrase. Just some say when you tighten or draw in,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHY2-nt-y4,1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhCmhVIcVFU,1
pretty sure you're talking about bracing.  The valsalva maneuver is the popular way to brace your core.  there's a bunch of tips and cues online.  above is a few youtube videos.,1
"He's talking about stomach vacuums, not bracing.",1
Is sweating necessary for seeing results? I feel the workout and I definitely have to push myself but I’m not dripping in sweat like I used to,1
No.,1
"I mean, I'm going to sweat more if I'm working out at muscle beach in the middle of summer compared to my garage in the middle of winter.  The workouts could be the exact same but the external temperature is what will determine how much I sweat.",1
"No, sweating is just a mechanism for human body to keep cool.",1
"It’s almost a year since I started working out. I’ve gotten significantly stronger since I started and I gained some definition in my arms, but I’m still skinny fat in my chest and stomach. Could carbs have something to do with it? If I weigh 188 pounds, what should by carb intake be? Any tips on how to lose this fat-especially on my chest?",1
"Calorie for calorie, carbs do not cause you to gain or retain any more fat than protein or fats do. The exact amount of carbs you eat isnt particularly important. Total calories is what matters.",1
"To lose fat, you should lose weight. You can't target fat loss.  I would read this: https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/",1
"You can't target fat loss, as for carbs. for me it's usually anything that is left. What I use:",1
Protein: 2.2–3.0 g/kg BW/day,1
Carbohydrates: 2–5 g/kg BW/day,1
Fats: 0.5–1.0 g/kg BW/day,1
Most important are proteins and fats.,1
You're just still new to the gym. It has nothing to do with carbs.,1
To lose fat you need to lose weight.,1
Even though I’m skinny fat? I’m currently lifting heavy and eating more,1
"If you want to lose fat, get into a calorie deficit. If you want to gain muscle go into a calorie surplus. If you want to do both slowly, eat at maintaince.",1
"Male, 23, 5'9 305, age",1
"Would doing half an hour of cardio , and ~half an hour of focused muscle work outs(around 30 reps per muscle group) be efficient for weight loss and muscle gain?For cardio, I do sandbag boxing, my base HR is 104, I try for >150 for 20-30 minutes",1
"For focused muscle workouts, i switch daily between""back, shoulders, and chest"" (Lat Pulls, Pec flys and Rear Delt Flys, Assisted Pullups)""biceps and triceps.""(Bicep Curls, Tri Extentions, and Tri Dips)and all until near failure.My lower body is currently strong enough because Im a big guy, so i daily carry a lot lolI run solo, so I use the machines rather than free weights for safety reasons.",1
"Edit: yea dw,  I'm making sure I eat below my daily caloric burn",1
"I run solo, so I use the machines rather than free weights for safety reasons",1
"Just learn to use the free weights: it's good for you, it's not as risky as you think, every movement can be done solo and failed safely on your own as well",1
"For focused muscle workouts,",1
"Focus on compounds and Why not follow a program from the wiki? This ""around 30 reps per muscle group"" thing sounds haphazard and unstructured and thus inefficient.",1
I know you think your lower body is strong because of your weight but doing lower body workouts is still good for you and being even stronger is healthier and better for you. Walking around and carrying your bodyweight is only somewhat conditioning and strengthening your lower body but it's not the same as a full depth squat or deadlift,1
"At your weight, your number one priority needs to be weight loss which will almost all be determined by your diet.",1
"Any exercise is infinitely better than none.  But no your program doesn't sound like the best, but if you like it that's cool, and as a beginner you will make gains with basically anything you do.  Some point i recommend you get on a real program.  I also would work out legs and do free weights, but you're totally free to do whatever you like.",1
"Weight loss is achieved in the kitchen, not the gym.",1
Heartrate >150 sounds a bit high for normal cardio IMO. For aerobic cardio you should shoot for 70-80% of your max HR. Thats an intensity you should be able to do for hours while just breathing through your nose.,1
Learn to use free weights. Those machine exercises have very often very little carryover to real strength exercises. You'll lack all the important stabilizing muscles.,1
"And you need some lower body training. Your lower body doesn't get strong by having a lot of weight, unless you are doing deep bodyweight squats all day.",1
How often do you work out currently?,1
"Sure, if you eat fewer calories than you burn.  I would recommend following a program from the wiki.",1
"So, just got back into the gym after being out for like a year or more. Went for the first time on Tuesday, decided to start with biceps because it’s most fun for me, and went way too hard.",1
"I still can’t move my arms and they hurt pretty bad. I’m not too worried about it, I screwed up but I’ll heal. But I’m feeling guilty about just starting and not being back since the first day, would it be a bad idea to go in and do legs today? Should I just take it easy on all working out until my arms heal?",1
"There’s not really anything to “heal” from. You’re not injured, just sore. Keep going to the gym, you could even hit biceps again since it’s been a few days and it’ll help with the soreness.",1
It's probably just DOMS. Doing more exercise usually helps.,1
"I've been lifting since a year. I can see triceps, biceps, shoulders, quads. How to know back muscles also developing?",1
When flexed I see only dents near/below shoulder blades?,1
"If you want to see it visually, take photos or use a mirror.",1
"Else than that, it's easier to determine your results based on your performance in the gym. That doesn't neccessarily mean 1RMs etc, just strength increases, more reps, more weight, better form, slower/more controlled reps on specific exercises. Usually, if those increase, your muscle size probably also increases.",1
What program are you doing? How has your weight changed since you started lifting?,1
"if im doing 21s bicep curls, do I do any other bicep exercises for that workout?",1
Thank you.,1
What does your program say?,1
"I’m currently trying to switch my ppl 6 day split to start on Monday, and I’m not sure how to convert. Should I take an extra rest day and then start push on Monday? Currently I have the split starting Sunday and then rest day is Saturday.",1
However you like. One day over the course of the entire time you spend training should be inconsequential.,1
"I'm supposed to hit my legs today, but I'm thinking of resting today and tomorrow, hitting my legs on Sunday, and then starting my new 6-day split on Monday with chest.",1
"Do whatever you want, it doesn't matter",1
"When doing lunges/Bulgarian split squats with one dumbbell, what's the difference between",1
holding dumbbell in the hand same side as front leg and holding it in the opposite hand of the front leg?,1
"The most notable difference will probably be the shift of the center of gravity. I'm honestly not sure if there is a noticable change in muscle hypertrophy for the quadriceps. Tho, I wouldn't overthink this too much.",1
Just use one dumbell if you wanna engage your core more or use two if you don't wanna bother with this at all.,1
"If I only lift about 2x per week on average (sometimes I can lift 1x sometimes 3x but my goal is to average 2x per week), do I really need to eat 1g of protein per lb of bodyweight?",1
"Lets assume the rule of thumb of 1g/1lb is correct, does this apply to people who lift 4-6 days a week? If i workout only 2x per week, i should be able to eat less protein per day right?",1
i should be able to eat less protein per day right?,1
This is not correct.,1
why is this not the case? I have trouble understanding why someone who lifts only 2x per week would need the same amount of protein as someone who lifts 5x per week (assuming each workout is the same between the two people),1
Because you can build muscle working out anywhere from 1 to 7 days a week.,1
"at some point tho my muscle is done building right ? if I lift monday only, are my muscles still building/ recovering on saturday ? in my mind I should be able to lower protein intake by the weekend since I assume my muscles are done recovering.",1
I dont believe i have seen workout frequency mentioned in protein intake discussions.,1
"Your muscles are ALWAYS repairing themselves. Even someone who doesn't work out, their body is always repairing itself as a response to you living.",1
1g/1lb is the high end of the recommendation as well. It's often .8-1g/1lb. I try and get close enough - usually aiming for a minimum of 100g a day (as a 140lb woman) which puts me a little under the .8g/1lb goal.,1
"Protein intake is mainly a daily average recommendation across any sort of training split. If getting protein in your diet isn't a difficulty (financially or physically) then getting the ""optimal"" protein in (1.3g-2.2g/kg per SBS podcast discussions) then it can be followed basically regardless of training split.",1
Is there a specific reason you want to lower your protein intake on certain days?,1

I use dumbbells instead of bar when I can ( I do as much one arm as I can, old injuries). I realize “1 arm” increases my time spent, I compensate by using supersets so my rest time is while I’m working the other muscle. This has worked for me fairly well since about 1985.",1
"Ive seen a bunch of overweight people (read: obese) people at my gym doing leg extensions at my gym, usually accompanied by their regularly sized friends.",1
"Is this not bad for their joints? They have an enormous amount of stress on their knees already, and placing more of that seems unnecessary and detrimental. I asked one of the personal trainers if it was, he said it was fine but I call bull. What do y'all think?",1
I think I do best when I mind my own business,1
Good on them that they're in the gym trying to get in better shape.,1
Also aren't you sitting down during leg extensions? So 1. it takes bodyweight out of the equation unlike a squat and 2. it just isolates the quads.,1
Why would training their legs be bad for their joints?,1
Can you not understand the concept of strengthening the muscles around a joint to make it more resilient?,1
Oh you post in redpill subs. DNI everybody.,1

"u/MunchingOnMaitotoxin - It's generally fine, provided there's no knee pain (which some people do experience).  That said, i'd probably prioritize some form of squatting motion over open-chain leg exercises.",1
Let's not beat around the bush and pretend that the poster had any genuine question here. It's just fatphobia parading as concern by somebody that likely isn't knowledgeable and yet feels superior to others in the gym because of their bmi.,1
"As for your point about shear forces. The shear forces experienced by obese people in the leg extension are of marginal difference to those experienced by those of normal weight. These horizontal shear forces on the knee during extension are barely, marginally aggravated by obesity as its the compressive force on the knee during load bearing, especially squats during knee flexion, that obese people will induce far more potential damage from (see: any article on the results and measurements of OIOA and its management). Further, the seated position allows for the reduction of shear and compressive forces at the hip flexors - this is a more pressing issue in those beginning resistance training as an obese individual - by reducing the internal stabilisation demands on the joints due to increased mass.",1
"Squatting is not only more risky from a load-bearing position for obese individuals, but the systemic fatigue demands are far higher due to increased stability demand -> less productive training.",1
Leg extensions are one of the best exercises obese individuals can perform when starting resistance training.,1
As long as you aren't swinging the weight up with zero control like a jackass most people won't get sore joints from a leg extension. Bring it up in a controlled manner and squeeze your quads at the top for a second.,1
"Obese person here. We can weight train like you do, too. Training our legs is just as beneficial for us as you toothpicks.",1
that we should all mind our own business in the gym,1
Why would leg extensions put stress on your knees?,1
"Would this be a good routine? I asked the same question yesterday but nobody gave an actual answer. If you think a ""time tested"" routine is better, tell me which one and why/ whats different about it. I looked through the wiki programs and this is based loosely off of the PPL split there except I added more leg volume, changed the progression because I am unable to linearly progress, and swapped bis and tris because they usually feel week after compounds.",1

"As the program progresses, add one rep to a working set per week on all movements. If you hit the top range for all working sets of a movement, increase weight until you can only do all sets for the lower range.   ~ Every 8 weeks, take a deload week, lowering all lifts by about 5% while maintaining reps and repeat the cycle.",1
"Between rest times, stretch isometrically muscle groups that are not being used. (Ex. Toe touches on day 1 or 2)",1
WARM UP- Before every workout,1
5 minute brisk walk while pre kicks in,1
Dynamic stretch for all muscle groups working,1
1-2 light sets before main compound lifts,1
I think the toe touches will wreck the routine.,1
"Seriously, Either do a proven routine, or do this and see how it goes.",1
"Generally with these things people will tell you to do the established routines because they work. If you don't want to do that, that's fine. Do your routine, see what happens. This is lifting. You're free to explore different methods and you don't need other people's permission to do so. If it doesn't work, cool, you'll have learned something new. If it does work, report back on your success.",1
"I’m just mainly asking for any critiques on the routine, whether or not it’s a good amount of intensity and volume or if it’s too little or too much",1
Yeah everyone will pretty much tell you it sucks and do an established routine. That's how any made up routine will go until it's proven to be successful.,1
"You didn’t get an answer because you should pick an established routine and follow it, since they have significantly stronger success rates.",1
Then tell me what is different because I’ve run these routines and have had little success,1
"What’s different is that they’ve been tried, tested, and repeatedly proven to work. What’s the longest you’ve run one program? How hard did you actually push yourself? Did you follow the prescribed progressions?",1
"Also, looking at this, there’s too much in here. If you can recover from this volume that’s all fine and well and do what you will, but this looks bananas compared to pre established routines.",1
It’s basically a PPL with a shit ton of extra volume and a wonky structure.,1
"If you insist on your own program, just shift it to be a PPL and see how it goes.",1
Everywhere Ive seen says mrv for most muscle groups is about 10-20 per week this would be the higher end of that. ~ how many weekly sets per muscle group would you recommend?,1
"Most programs built around MEV/MRV concepts aren't static like yours, though.",1
"You don't jump in on day one and hit your MRV and stay there for an entire cycle.  That's not sustainable.  You start a cycle closer to your MEV, build to your MRV (and often overload beyond MRV in the final week), and then deload and start again.",1
All of the routines I’ve seen in the wiki are extremely low intensity and volume and that doesn’t work for me,1
"Then do this Frankenstein routine you created. It's like you want to get into an argument with people about how ""dumb"" the tried and true routines are.",1
That means you've only looked at the beginner programs. Try again,1
Recommend one you wouldn’t consider beginner,1
5/3/1 BBB and Building the Monolith are explicitly not beginner programs.,1
Jon Andersen's Deep Water Method has intermediate and advanced templates.,1
I don't think the Layne Norton program is an appropriate beginner program.,1
"However, the tough question: why do you think you're not a beginner?",1
"Any of them that don't say ""beginner.""",1
The daily volume and intensity in your proposed plan is about the same as the 5/3/1 templates and less than some of the other bulking/hypertrophy programs,1
Then run this.,1
The general consensus around here is to pick a program from the wiki and run it.,1
"I don’t know if you’ve seen my other comments, but if I were you I would just pick either a six day PPL or literally any three day program in the wiki.",1
"They are definitely not, you just don’t know how to train and that is proven by your responses here.",1

I'm doing GZCLP plus a few isolation exercises each training session. Should I add chest flies as well to stimulate the chest further or are those muscles already covered by the bench press?,1
"If yes, should I do floor flies or bench flies and should I do it on bench press day or OHP day?",1
You can do them twice a week if you like. They shouldn't affect recovery much,1
"Chest flies or pullovers are a great weighted stretch move to combine with bench pressing. I prefer pullovers honestly, little better on my shoulders and I feel like I got more out of them in terms of adding strength than flies. Keeping the pecs engaged takes a bit of practice but I think they are really worth it. Cables flies would be better than dumbbell flies if you still want to do flies unless you're really proficient in keeping the tension in your chest at the top of the movement.",1
I use an EZ bar for my pullovers and don't plan on going back to flies unless I get a functional trainer or something at my house.,1
What does it mean that my weight-rep ratios are far off from everything the 1rm calculators and formulas suggest? I'm way better at benching smaller weights for high reps than higher weight for fewer reps.,1
"For example today I benched 70kg for 12, which according to calculators suggests my 1rm is almost 100. Last week I benched 75 for 5, which would suggest 1rm slightly over 90. But in reality I can barely bench 85 for 1.",1
Those calculations get really inaccurate for rep numbers >3 imo.,1
"Also, training with heavy weights and low reps is also kind of a skill, that you don't especially train, when doing higher reps. It's just slightly different.",1
Those formulas get more inaccurate the higher the reps/set is.,1
But it's already super inaccurate with relatively little reps? I'm guessing it'd even overestimate my 1rm when doing three reps.,1
I just mean that the ratio/curve for my body is obviously different from the average with a preference for higher rep numbers.,1
"Are you looking for a computer program/calculator to accurately,  100%, spot-on predict the human body?",1
"There are a number of different formulas for calculating e1RM.  If you plug in 75 kg for 5 reps, you'll get 87.5 kg e1RM using the Epley formula.  If you use the Brzycki formula, you get 84.4 kg e1RM.  Those are probably 2 of the more popular ones.",1
Both of those are pretty close to your actual 1RM.,1
It’s not “super inaccurate” even in your example.  It’s an imperfect tool.  There’s not much more to it than that.,1
"For example today I benched 70kg for 12, which according to calculators suggests my 1rm is almost 100.",1
Calculators get very inaccurate the higher the reps are. They are good for estimating your 1RM when you tested your 5 rep max.,1
"It can mean that your conditioning is good, that you have a lot of practice with high reps, and/or that you have fairly little practice with singles.",1
Rep calculators make a good guess. It's not an exact science. Doing 275 x 5 doesn't mean you have the skill necessary for 315 x 1.,1
"I get too exhausted after i get to bicep, I think it might happen beocuse my bicep is working when i do chest beforehand, I have to wait 2-3 minutes before sets for the rest of the excercises and it makes my workout significantly longer, Should i just move bicep to the end of the workout and do 2 excercises instead of 3?",1
Should i just move bicep to the end of the workout and do 2 excercises instead of 3?,1
Sure. You could also lower the weight.,1
"If your biceps are tired from working chest, you either have form issues or you just don't have the mind muscle connection yet. Your biceps shouldn't be fatigued from really any chest exercise.",1
Should I coordinate my morning lifting and afternoon running schedules in some fashion?,1
"Right now I do a full body (bench, squat, pull down, curl, deadlift; variations change daily to keep it less boring) workout every other morning and my running schedule is hard run-recovery run-recovery run-repeat, so some days I'm doing hard runs on lifting days and some days I'm not.",1
"I'm not hitting any recovery issues yet, but I'm also just getting back into this and want to avoid problems in the future.",1
Should I coordinate my morning lifting and afternoon running schedules in some fashion?,1
Only in the sense that it should work for you. There are no hard rules here regarding when/how you should schedule your training. It's all about personal preference and finding what works best for you.,1
Half your runs being hard runs is problematic honestly.  Most running coaches are not going to recommend that at all.  I would shift up your running and make it so most of your running (80-90%) is easy.  Do your hard runs on days you're not lifting.,1
Im having trouble with my forearms fatiguing on pullups and am worried them being a limiting factor in my ability to do as many pullups as possible.,1
For context I can do 15 pullups for a Max set and weigh 72 kg. I've been an intermediate level rock climber for 4 years and consider my grip strength to be pretty good.,1
I was wondering if there something wrong with my form that was putting much load onto my forearms Or if i simply need to do more forearm exercises in isolation and am being overconfident in my climbingn background.,1
Thanks in advance,1
You can go down two routes here depending on your overall goals.,1
- If you're trying to strengthen up for rock climbing then adding in some kind of forearm isolation could do wonders for your grip and overtime help the fatigue problem,1
-If you're just trying to build a nice back then straps aren't a terrible idea. You won't train your grip as effectively but the forearms should no longer be a limiting factor allowing you to do more good pullups,1
So yeah really it depends on whether you're looking to build the forearms up or just be better at pullups,1
As a climber you shouldn't have problems with pull ups tbh. Where do you place the bar in your hands? Could be that you are relying on your finges too much and not using your whole hands.,1
Do you use chalk when doing pullups? I find it pretty helpful.,1
can do 4-6pull ups whats best way to get this number higher quickly?,1

I'm a 58kg F 164 cm. I've been going go the gym since a year now. I've been skinny fat most of my life. So I've been on a defecit of about 300 cal but i can't see any of my belly fat being lost and my muscles aren't growing either. So I've decided to bulk and then cut. I need some advice related to that. How long should I bulk and will it be very difficult to lose the fat when i cut later? Should I do heavier weights with less reps?,1
Try here:,1
https://thefitness.wiki/muscle-building-101/,1
Are you following a proper muscle building program?,1
How long should I bulk,1
"I'd say bulk at least 10lbs if you're doing a lean bulk. But max, i'd say stay within a healthy weight range for your height according to the BMI chart. That's the approach i've taken (5'7F) and have made good results.",1
will it be very difficult to lose the fat when i cut later?,1
"If you can stick to a deficit, no, it shouldn't. It should, in theory, be easier. Muscle burns more calories than fat, so your TDEE should be ever so slightly higher. Throw in some cardio while you're bulking to get your overall fitness up so that you can continue that while cutting so your calories are higher. I was cutting having 1800-2000 calories a day cus I was doing so much biking and walking. Much more sustainable than eating 1500 calories (for me... I fucking love food though).",1
Should I do heavier weights with less reps?,1
"You should follow a set routine. See the wiki. It will likely be a mix of high weight, low reps and low weight, high reps.",1
"Been mixing yogurt, protein powder, and high-protein granola for a post-workout meal, but finally made the mistake of getting vanilla yogurt and vanilla protein powder, turning it into a bit of vanilla overkill.",1
I’ve seen the gif of the kid eating straight cocoa powder and am hesitant to go that route with my yogurt to cut out some of the vanilla. Is cocoa powder good to mix with yogurt?,1
"Sorry not super fitness-related, but I️ would call it diet/nutrition",1
Try a little portion and see what you think. Cocoa powder usually needs extra sweetener to make it palatable.,1
In your situation I would probably get some unsweetened powder to mix with the vanilla yogurt and vice versa. You’ll eat it all eventually.,1
I’ve been doing Bulgarian split squats with the smith machine for the past month or 2. Apparently it’s not good for the joints and forces you to move awkwardly so now I want to leave the smith machine and just do normal Bulgarian split squats. The problem is I have no balance whatsoever and I have very flat feet. Is it possible for me to develop balance to be able to do a regular Bulgarian split squat? I’m thinking of just using a bench next to a wall. I stand with one hand on the wall and the other hand holding a weight. Will I still be able to grow muscle doing this? Or should I just start without a wall and just do body weight Bulgarian split squat? The problem is even with no weight I’m falling over to the side and my foot won’t stay flat on the ground. I feel like it would take me forever to even work my way up to holding 2Kg in each hand without falling over. This means no muscle growth/ hypertrophy. What’s the best course of action for me to take?,1
Is it possible for me to develop balance to be able to do a regular Bulgarian split squat?,1
"Yes, just do it",1
"Either with the balance or just do it, forget for a moment about every single exercise being meant to maximize muscle growth, and consider that balancing mostly on one leg is kind of a basic aspect of physical movement and health. It sounds like you're a beginner so 1. You're probably not lacking sufficient stimulus to grow, you'll grow almost no matter what, and 2. You shouldn't be thinking in terms of hyper specializing into getting jacked, build a base of strength, fitness, and proprioception and control over your own body.",1
"If my balance were that bad I would definitely want to improve it, and practicing things like Bulgarian split squats that challenge your balance is a great way to do that. If that means starting with body weight, that is what I would do.",1
Fyi I don't think flat feet and poor balance are correlated. I have flat feet and have always had good balance.,1
Yes this is something you can improve. One of the tips that helped me is to rotate the knee of your lifted leg slightly outward to provide more stability during the movement.,1
A question for people who have gained a lot of weight working out.,1
Since mid 2021 I went from 64 to 72kg. The progress is noticeable but I don't think any of the newfound muscle mass/fat made my wrists any bigger (I do exercise forearms regularly) so I'm curious if continuing to gain weight will eventually make it's way to my wrists.,1
"There aren't many muscles in the wrists them selves. The muscles are in the forearms with long tendons which pass through the wrist. tendons don't hypertrophy much compared to muscles so the wrists themselves rarely grow a lot. I have very narrow wrists and they've got slightly bigger, but not by a huge amount (maybe a single hole on a watch strap) over a 10 year period where I've gained about 25kg since I was a teen.",1
"Best Android app to log accessory movement weight, sets, and reps, that has visualizations over time to show improvement? Bonus points if it is open source.",1
A google spreadsheet? I've searched for similar app for ages and never found anything I like particularly.,1
"Ive had fuckaround-itis forever and didn't get very far the times I did go hard. I finally decided to just do it and went on a long cut from 180lbs to 150lbs while lifting so that I wouldn't hate myself for a while. I've been doing ice cream fitness (v1, I know he sucks but I initially just picked something and stuck with it) while cutting to maintain and obviously didn't see any progress due to the weight loss. All of this was expected. My question is: now that I'm eating and bulking, but my lift numbers are still beginner (145lb 5x5 bench, 115 OHP, 180lb squat) and I'm not progressing at these linear levels like SS and ICF say (5lbs per session? Oof) I'm curious if I should stick with a beginner program even though I'm very familiar with lifting and not getting crazy noob gains, or I should try something else? It's worth noting that previously when I ran ICF I was at 185lb 5x5 bench so I haven't even gotten to where I was on a beginner program last time. I'm tempted to check out Greyskull LP but the volume seems much less than what I was doing. Thoughts?",1
"Beginner linear progression programs are good for 12-16 weeks as you learn how to lift weights and get your body use to the movements.  After that time, moving onto a real program, with a variety of movements and rep ranges alongside a logical and sustainable progression scheme and some manner of periodizaiton is a great approach.  Jim Wendler lays out a great plan here",1

"For the last 2 weeks I've had a lot of success staying motivated by just doing pushup/sit-ups throughout the day (in addition to cardio), since I can do them in short bursts. That way it doesn't take as much willpower to get started on a particular set, and I don't get bored doing it. I can only do about 30 push-ups at a time, so what I do is 5 - 10 sets of 20-25 pushup throughout the day.  Similar process with sit-ups, alternating days with pushups. So I'm doing like ~150 each, every other day.",1
"I guess my question is: will this do anything? I feel marginally stronger, my chest seems a bit tighter, but I can't really tell how much it is helping. Alternatively, is there any way to modify this kind of regimen (many small sets throughout the day) so it will be more helpful?",1

Sometimes meeting your goals means doing things you don't particularly enjoy.,1

Maybe try different things.,1
"When I first started at the gym, just going and doing say 3x10 <insert exercise here> for like 5 exercises was dull af. Then I was introduced to kettlebell circuits. I LOVE the kettlebell exercises because it has way more movement to it so I feel like i'm doing more. Throw in a few bodyweight stuff (pushups, pullups, ab work) and you can get a solid workout just from a few kettlebells.",1
"Once I got fitter, I can now manage a 'regular' workout and enjoy it more. But the kettlebell stuff was great to get me there. You don't have to go every day as well. 3x a week for an hour is enough to get some muscle on you!",1
Not really for your goals. Hypertrophy is achieved through repetition in a short period of time and spacing out your sets that way would not be the best way to achieve it.,1

Yeah I keep telling her that lifting won't create a bulky appearance unless she starts to legitimately bulk.,1
She has this fantastic habit of not listening to my advice until someone else says it haha.,1
"Even if she legitimately bulks... it takes a LOT of work to get bulky. I say that as a woman who WANTS to get a well defined upper body! Flexed, I have big arms. Unflexed, my arms look almost like my mom's arms do... and she struggles to pick up a 10lb dumbbell -.-",1

Fitbod (paid) and Caliber (free) will build workouts for her every day if she wants some variety.  I've used both and like caliber more since it's free.  Easy to set templates as well if you get to a structured program.,1
"Thank you! I'll give Caliber a shot, but honestly I wouldn't be opposed to spending a few bucks on an app if it gets my SO more active and makes her happier with her exercise routine.",1
"I'm going to download Caliber right now and check it out, thank you!",1
liftvault.com and google sheets.,1
"She may enjoy something like the smartwod app. You put in the movements you want to do, tap the button, and it spits out a WOD. That'll give her the variation she wants.",1
What’s your go to cutting breakfast? Looking for ideas.,1
Me at the moment: 4 sliced boiled eggs mixed into a can of tuna with a 2-scoop protein shake.,1
100g of protein. Done.,1
I go straight to lunch,1
"Personally, coffee. Fast until 2PM.",1
"Previously, eggs, 0% cottage cheese, chicken bacon.",1
Steak and eggs with avocado.,1
"I do 3 eggs, greek yogurt, chicken sausage and an english muffin with blackberry jam every morning.  600 calories, 51g protein.",1
"I eat 300 grams of quark, it's like 30 grams of protein. I throw in a few rice cakes if I have them too if the calorie/carb budget allows for it",1
I downloaded the Metallicadpa 6 Day PPL spreadsheet from liftvault and had a noob question.,1
"The main lifts intentionally start at a low weight as mentioned by the program creator - ""These are intentionally a little low since the intensity increases so quickly on this program. Be patient. "". But for accessories, did you guys start at the low weight prescribed by the program too? Ex. My 1 rm for lat pulldown is 110 so according to the calculations in the spreadsheet I should start at 3x8 at 40lbs? Similarly with tricep pushdown, curls etc.",1
"I was thinking of starting with the low weights for the main lifts, and for accessories just going as heavy as I can for 8-12 reps and follow some rep based progression. Appreciate any advice!",1
I followed it as prescribed. You'll find you'll catch up in a few weeks anyways.,1
"really struggling to lose weight since I started lifting. Never been one for cardio but I could give it a shot, but for now I’d like to understand if lifting can have an effect on how fast you can lose weight. This is my first cut in 1.5 years since I started lifting. I used to be really skinny simply by walking (6-10k a day) I stopped prioritizing my walks to bulk and have made some lovely gains. Been trying to go on a cut but after the first 4 pounds I can’t seem to lose any more weight even with lifting and walking 8-10k steps a day. Is this normal? Or should I start eating less on top of walking more",1
Nobody in the history of man has ever loss weight without being in a caloric deficit. It's quite simple you need to eat less.,1
should I start eating less,1
"Yes, the biggest factor in weight loss is your diet.",1
https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/,1
I was always successful in losing a significant amount of weight simply by having an active lifestyle walking everywhere. This is just new to me as I naturally have a high metabolism and never had to consider food as much. Just curious what’s different this time,1
Are you actually tracking your calories?,1
"Its probably less so anything to do with your metabolism and more so to do with you may be eating more since you started lifting and just haven't noticed. If anything, your metabolism should be higher if you have more muscle mass (unless you've also started taking any medication that could tank your metabolism).",1
"But for anyone, if you aren't losing weight, you are eating too much. End of story. If your metabolism tanked cus of medication or something, sorry life sucks for you, but you just gotta eat less. You can make it a little easier on yourself by exercising more, but you gotta balance your recovery too (which will be more difficult the longer you're in a cut)",1
"Wanna get into abit of weight lifting, right now i only do cardio via boxing most often.",1
I am looking at either adjustable dumbells from 5-25kg (11 lbs-55lbs) or would it be better to get a barbell set for around the same price with dumbells and weight plates up to 60kg (132 lbs) which i guess i would be able to buy more weights to later if i ever would need that.,1
So wondering what would be the best to buy.,1
"Only you can answer this. We don't know your strength, what types of programs you want to run, your budget, how much space you have...",1
Maybe look at r/homegym,1
A decent quality Olympic barbell and plates would be the first thing I buy.,1
"Ideas for lower body training when you have a ribcage injury? I am doing leg press and abduction/adduction machines now but have had to give up almost everything else (deadlifts, squats, hip thrusts)",1
Belt squats might work? No upper body loading whatsoever.,1
"I’m getting a new schedule at work, working 3.5 days on, 3.5 days off.",1
"Would have if a strength focused week and a hypertrophy focused week be enough volume for increasing both strength and size? (I.e., 5/3/1 linear progression the first week, PPL the second week, then repeat).",1
You can increase strength and size with just one program run during that time.  Muscles get stronger when you make them bigger.,1
"I'd just take a 3 day program and run it back to back for the 3 days I have off, then rest for the off days.",1
531 isn’t a linear progression program(it uses wave progression and PPL is a split not a program.,1
531 BBB would do both for you. Why not do that?,1
"Working out 4 times a week (Mon, W, T,Fri) doing full body workouts each time. But varying the exercises each time (same muscle groups).",1
Is this ok?,1
My trainer says it is and he’s confident it won’t hurt.,1
Why have you hired a trainer who you don't trust enough to set something as basic as your workout frequency?,1
As long as youre recovering well enough then it’s fine,1
"It should be fine, given you're sleeping and eating well enough to recover. If you're a beginner, your trainer is probably trying to build up a base in order to structure a full routine.",1
Yes this is actually good as the variation offers a form of recovery through new movement patterns. This concept is how westside lifters became some of the best.,1
Should I be using smaller plates on barbell glute bridge for full rom? The 45s give me a few inches of clearance and I’m wondering if I should just use 35s so that I push from the very beginning of the lift,1
So what good apps everybody uses to keep track of macros and your workouts(crossfit),1
"For nutrition I found Macrofactor to be great. For tracking my workouts I swear by Fitnotes, I've been using it for years and it's awesome",1
I strongly second MacroFactor,1
"any kind of spreadsheet for me has been better than any app, for me the amount of junk I have to do to put food into fatsecret/whatever is annoying when I can just figure out cals/protein from google and punch it into a sheet.",1
I do 5/3/1 so i have a sheet template for that that works well.,1
Google Sheets,1
"I have an android phone, and I use Cronometer for macro tracking and Fitnotes for workout tracking.  Both very good apps, and 100% free",1
I have issues with bloating from IBS. If I strengthen my abs. Would it help contain the bloating?,1
Probably not,1
"I have a pair of those reebok classics, they are hilariously narrow. I don't think I'd squat or deadlift in them for that reason.",1
I wear my club cs to the gym every day. My favourite shoe! I must have narrow feet.. For squat / dead’s I always take them off and go with socks though.,1
they'd be fine probably if they fit you alright,1
Can you fast one day a week and not lose muscle?,1
The amount of muscle that could be lost in just 1 day without some sort of surgery would be measurable in single grams.,1
Yes,1
How do I figure out my macros for a lean bulk?,1
Stronger by science has a good article on this: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/bulking/,1
,1
A TLDR; would be take in 1.6-2.2g of protein kg of body mass then fill in the rest of carbs and fat.,1
0.8-1.1g of daily protein per lb of bodyweight and minimum 0.3g of daily fat per lb of bodyweight.,1
Everything else is personal preference up to your calorie target. The wiki has diet advice for building muscle as well,1
"is that for people who lift 5x per week? What if i only lift 2x per week, can I do 0.5g per lb of bodyweight? I have more rest between workouts, I assume I can eat less protein.",1
Protein is needed to build muscle. You might be recovering properly but that doesn't mean you're necessarily eating enough to maximize muscle growth,1
https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/eat-to-get-big-without-getting-fat/,1
"It’s honestly vastly different from person to person. Unless you’re going to a dietitian there is not really an exact science, and I’ve even heard of dietitians that don’t produce the results desired. I recommend downloading a fitness tracking app and doing around 1-1.5g per lb for protein. The rest will be carbs and fats. I function best with higher carb numbers. I’m typically in the 200 gram per day of carbs, eating lots of greens like broccoli, spinach, potatoes, asparagus, with some rice or protein pasta. Chicken or beef for dinner. Start every day off with egg scramble and a side of trail mix.",1
It’s all about personal preference. Oh and don’t forget to make sure you’re getting a good amount of fiber in your diet. It helps keep you regular and if you’re regular your weight will be most accurate. Hope that helps.,1
Any ideas for a replacement for eggs? Allergic to egg whites unfortunately,1
"You can do a protein shake, any dairy products like greek yogurt or cheeses, and a breakfast meat. I love turkey bacon.",1
A few quick questions:,1
How importance is assistance work for a beginner? I find it really time consuming compared to just focusing on my main lifts.,1
"Is a smith machine suitable for back squats and front squats, or should I stick to the standard squat rack?",1
"How long should I be resting between sets? I get bored after a minute or so, but I worry that I am taking things too fast.",1
Context:,1
"26m, 120lbs, 5’7",1
"B=100lb, S=155lb, D=150lb, OHP=60lb",1
6 weeks working out so far,1
ran 5/3/1 before switching to nSuns this week,1
"Less important than a more advanced lifter. Beginners are volume sensitive, it doesn't take much.",1
Smith squats are fine but just understand they are a different exercise than barbell squats. Other than specificity there is no real argument against them. I still prefer barbells.,1
2-5 minutes is normal.,1
"Meh. You could get away with not doing it for now, but you’ll want to do it sooner or later unless you want to have DYEL arms, calves, and shoulders after lifting for years. Most people don’t.",1
"At the end of the day, the smith machine will still make you bigger and stronger. It’s probably advisable you do squats with a barbell, though - the fixed ROM on a smith machine can be awkward or hard on the joints. It’s also a different setup than barbell.",1
"Anywhere from 1-5 minutes is pretty standard. I personally rest 2-3 for compounds and <2 for accessory work. Sometimes I’ll go higher than 3 for main work if I’m dragging or about to go for a PR. YMMV. If you feel ready to go, you probably are.",1
My skin started to tear recently when doing a Barbell row (started lifting about 7 months ago). Basically the area between palm and fingers where I grip the bar.,1
Do I just need to let this happen and let some calluses develop or is there an issue with my grip or something?,1
"I used to have a similar problem. Calluses will help. Biggest difference is to make sure you're not pinching skin when gripping the bar. If you put your palm on the bar then wrap your fingers around, it's easy to pinch. Instead, I found placing the line between fingers and palm on the bar first, then wrapping both the fingers and palm around at the same time massively helped.",1
Rippetoe being non-memeworthy on grip.,1
"You’re probably not gripping the bar properly. If it’s uncomfortable, you got sweaty hands or your wrist isn’t as strong, you can either work on grip strength or using straps",1
"Calluses will come, definitely let them!",1
"Hell, I haven't done any hand gripper work in many months and I honestly still have skin that feels like sandpaper at the part of my palms just underneath the base of my fingers. I have never made an effort nor had any desire to revert the skin back to pre-callused days, mind you.",1
"I lost them briefly when covid started, regaining was a throwback to the first time i seriously started working out over a decade ago!",1
