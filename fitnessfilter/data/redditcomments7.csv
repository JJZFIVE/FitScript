"Need some advice.I work 11am - 9pm Tuesday - Saturday. Do I workout before work, or workout after work?I work a GM role at a busy restaurant, I'm leaning towards going after work. I feel my most alive at night and I feel like I can benefit from this. I literally feel like death the entire day, second 7pm/8pm hits I perk up.Or will forcing myself to wake up earlier and getting into gym before work, will snap me out of this laziness?",1
"Fitbits, and similar smart watch type fitness trackers. Are they actually useful and worth getting? Has anyone found they helped them with their fitness? When I read up on them, they look like expensive pedometer watches.",1
"(I know its not a strictly routine, nutrition or diet question but I felt it was on topic)",1
"I think you're much better off buying good running shoes, a belt/knee sleeve/straps, or really anything else.",1
I use them mostly for the sleep tracker gimmick.  I go through periods where I don't wear it at all and periods where I wear it religiously.,1
"I use a Coros Pace 2 and find it helpful for both running and weight training.  For WT, I program my routine (which allows for quite a bit of flexibility) and it helps keep me on track with timings and next sets.  It does a fairly good job keeping track of reps, but it's not perfect...  It also tracks HR and comes with an inspirational muscle map that shows progress (based on sets done over time).",1
"It's among the cheapest ""race"" watches and I've found it to be quite helpful.",1
"6'2"" 248 lbs, (barely) 30",1
"I was 280 in October and have been dieting to lose weight. Target is 200ish, depending on muscle mass. I've gotten into a good routine, food wise and want to start working out soon. I am wondering if y'all have any helpful tips on how to keep consistent and set myself up for success?",1
"I want a solid core, around a 6 pack, but want to set realistic, smaller goals instead of one big one. Are there some milestones that I can try and work towards?",1
"If it matters, I belong to a gym which has a pool + all normal gym machines and equipment",1
"Depending on how strong you are you may have already hit these number, but 1234 plates for OHP (135), bench (225), squat (315), deadlift (405) is a good beginner goal.",1
Otherwise picking a program where you hit regular rep PR’s like 531 or the Stronger by Science strength programs is a good way to have tangible results. I like using Google sheets to track my workouts. It also lets me look back at what has worked to make me stronger so I can use it again.,1
Shooting for shortening your workout times is also fun. I’m on a cut currently and trying to superset everything I can and keep my rest times as short as possible to increase my work capacity.,1
"I had a headache on the back of my head after doing a 30 min heavy workout. I haven't done any exercise this heavy in a long time, what did I do wrong, or is it that my body isn't used to doing that much activity.",1
Unlikely to be connected to be honest. Maybe dehydration if anything?,1
Two questions for sitting leg curls am I trying to do a kick back like inwards on shortest path possible or am I trying to do it on a long path?,1
Also planning to remove leg press from my routine would front squats be suitable?,1
I already do deadlifts and low bar squats.,1
"I don't understand your first question, most machines will keep you on a pretty strict path.",1
Yes.,1
What's a proper way to warm up before starting lifting weights ? What should I do ? I'm a beginner.,1
"I take 5 minutes to do some jumping jacks then movements to warm up my joints (e.g. wrist and arm rotations, various waist movements, cat/cow, etc...)",1
I do reps with progressively heavier weights until I hit my working weight. If something feels tight I'll do some dynamic stretches but typically I just do the movement I'm warming up for.,1
I am lookkng for an app to track my 5x5 workouts.,1
I also want to use the accessory excercises.,1
I cant really spend on the  stronglifts app.,1
"FitNotes is my favourite, it's not pretty but it's really easy to setup and track workouts",1
I use google sheets and a spreadsheet from liftvault.,1
25yo 100-105kg 190cm Have a fat stomach and fat upper legs I want to loose Best exercises for that?,1
Fork put-downs usually does the trick.,1
On a serious note - you can't spot reduce fat in specific areas and you definitely can't do it with specific exercises. The only way to lose it is being in a caloric deficit.,1
"Im 26y/0, 185cm, 60kgs and do not workout Im hungry and I want to eat more but am afraid ill gain fat Is it okay to go 300kcal> my weekly kcal intake and start working out somehow tomorrow? Any advice from where to begin?",1
"At 185cm, 60kgs you're already quite skinny so 300-500 calories would benefit you a lot.",1
"If you're looking for where to begin, reading the subreddits wiki is definitely a good place for information and beginner programs.",1
"doing the beginner PPL and i'm my progress on bench is impacting by incline. Today I benched 5 sets of 5x190, and then could only do 8, 7, and then 6 at 60lb dumbbells after doing 3 sets of 10 at 60 two weeks ago. This is the fourth workout in a row that I've been unable to progress at incline, despite my bench consistently going up. SHould I de-load to 55lb on my next set of incline?",1
Think I'm in the same boat as you with this. I'm taking it as my chest is fucked after normal bench but should also deload my incline.,1
Sounds like a good plan,1
"Running icecreamfitness 2.0 rn, what does adding 5lbs every session mean? For squats for example, should I be adding 5lbs every time I come into the gym (so +15lbs at the end of the 3 full body days)? Or should it be every other day? Thanks",1
"Hi all, thanks for any advice,",1
So with my workouts I've got a question. What's better:,1
Doing a workout that covers limited areas (e.g. just chest and back) but works individual muscles for a longer amount of time,1
or,1
Doing a workout that covers a more general area (e.g. whole of upper body) but works individual muscles for a shorter amount of time,1
"Should I be rotating my workouts to cover different muscles & muscle groups, or should I be doing the same workout everytime which covers all bases but will obviously mean less focus on individual muscle and muscle groups?",1
Both are good and should be utilized. I'd do one of the programs from the wiki as they have everything already thought out for you.,1
"Compound lifts are better- squats, deadlifts, bench press, overhead press, pull-ups, rows, etc.  and form the base of any solid training program.",1
How to keep pushing on routine during a cold weather.,1
The same as you do when it's hot but with more clothes on.,1
I am just looking for some recommended online hypertrophy subscription programs.,1
"I have been training for years and am comfortable in the gym, however, just looking to mix things up to curb some boredom and increase accountability.",1
Looking to spend no more than $50 P/M,1
John Meadows' programs are kick ass. The SBS hypertrophy template is also good.,1
The renaissance periodization programs are top tier.,1
"The physique templates for example includes a 18week program(if I remember correctly) that you can run forever basically without it getting stale because of the varied exercise selection and the three focuses in each mesocycle. That being standard hypotrophy, metabolite and strength.",1
"I got mine ""for free"" and loved it so much I ended up actually buying it.",1
Any tips for staying motivated?,1
"I have trouble staying motivated to continue with things if I don't see results quickly, so I was wondering if you had any tips to help stay motivated",1
Have a difficult but achievable goal to shoot for.,1
Motivation will eventually run out always,1
Discipline > motivation,1
"Don’t think of it as choosing to go to the gym.  Instead schedule out time beforehand as this is the time i go to the gym.  Approach that allocated time with the mindset that any excuse which wouldn’t be valid to miss work, isn’t valid to miss gym time.",1
"Programmes with AMRAP sets are fun because it let's you aim for a new PR every session, so you see results regularly.",1
Anyone know a chest isolation exercise that I can do at home?,1
Whenever I do chest I only feel it in my triceps and delts so hopefully an isolation exercise will help me feel my chest.,1
Db chest fly or cable chest fly.,1
"Push-ups, especially with a wide grip or on boxes. I'd also recommend buying a cheap set of gymnastics rings if you have somewhere to hang them, so you can do ring dips (and lots of other good stuff)",1
Can I work out even tho my left wrist hurts?,1
Like 3 days ago I was warming up and accidentally smashed my left wrist against some plates. Since then it is somewhat hurting when I am bending my hand. Can I still train for example back or legs or should I let my body recover completely first?,1
"I know, it is somewhat dumb smashing your wrist against a plate when warming up but yea:..happens",1
Of course you can. Your legs and wrists are different body parts.,1
"I've been having some trouble progressing on bench. At first I was doing 3x5, but that turned into doing 5-3-1, and now I am doing first set as my heavy set for 3-5 reps, and my last two sets I drop the weight and aim for 8 reps but really focusing on feeling the muscle. For example on my last bench session I did 215 for 3 reps, then 185 for 7 and then on my last set I got 185 for 5. My main goal is to build a bigger chest, but it has also been a long term goal of mine to be able to rep out 2 plates. Is this a bad way of doing it?",1
Increasing frequency is something that helped me a ton and it seems to be pretty common advice. Add in 1-2 extra bench/bench variation days and see how you feel.,1
Are you just doing 3 working sets for bench or are you doing more backoffs like FSL or SSL in 531?,1
"Doing one heavy set, and a few lighter sets is not a bad way of doing it. Are all sets to near failure? If you have been plateuing for many weeks it could be time to try something else though.",1
How often do you bench? What is your bw? Are you able to figure out your weak points?,1
Any tips for being able to sit cross legged (on the floor like in yoga)? Feels very stiff and uncomfortable when I try,1
"Maybe some butterfly, pidgeon or frog stretches? Something that open up your hips.",1
"But if a weird question to be honest, but I (as a guy) can only sit cross legged when I'm lean enough, otherwise my thighs will crush my nuts.",1
"Randomly started getting weaker, had less energy, and was borderline depressed. Nothing has changed but my physique has definitely improved looks wise, although somehow I appear to have lost a bit of weight (190lbs bw) yet appear to have gained some fat.",1
10 rep max bench has gone down (225 10 rep down to 8 rep). I do have a shoulder injury but it's almost entirely healed and I was still benching my usual weight when my shoulder was at it's worst.,1
"Randomly started getting weaker, had less energy, and was borderline depressed.",1
"Being low in iron, B12 or D could do this.",1
They are some of the most common deficiencies.,1
There is definately a big correlation between stress and mental health and performance in the gym.,1
"You just did too much too soon. What was your recovery program like? If you were just resting/medicine and jumped in with weighted squats, no surprise there was some regression. Modern back injury recovery is very much about active recovery, slowly with very easy stuff, starting with isometric holds etc. If you had a program and your physiotherapist said it's time for that amount of squats, talk to them and tell it was too much. If you had a program and jumped ahead, don't do that. If you don't have a training program, get one - physiotherapy if you can access that.",1
"That's not normal, go see a physiotherapist or a doctor. Sounds like you might need further rest and rehab for your lower back.",1
How do y'all keep your protein intake up? I recently (I mean finally) bought a scale and just realized just how much I've been undereating when it comes to protein. One chicken breast has only about 30g so that would mean I'd have to eat 4 whole chicken breasts (or equivalent) a day to get my needed 120g. Or about 20 eggs. I know there's trace proteins in veggies and carbs but the most of it would have to come from animal products. I'm considering taking protein powder at this point but they're super expensive and don't last that long. Any tips?,1
I keep a big bag of roasted chicken thighs in the fridge. Protein shakes help a lot too.,1
Protein powder,1
"According to MyFitnessPal, 100g chicken breast is 30g of protein.  That is a small chicken breast you are eating.  Try eating 150g to bump your protein intake to 45g per meal.",1
Protein powder is the cheapest protein\weight you can get.  Making a protein shake for a snack is a simple way to increase protein.,1
You need to get protein in EVERY meal.  Breakfast included.  Do you have trouble eating a lot of food?,1
Protein powder is actually pretty cheap per gram of protein. Compare it to say chicken breast,1
"Peanut butter, milk, Greek yoghurt, tuna",1
"Low fat dairy products, legumes, beans, tofu, peas, and yeah, protein powder.",1
"When returning to gym after being out sick for a week and losing a couple pounds, should you lower your working weight for the first few workouts or can you just lift what you’ve been lifting if you can?",1
Doesn’t matter,1
Lower load and volume. You will be back to your old self in just a couple weeks.,1
Probably lower things and take a workout or two to get into the groove and go. Can't hurt.,1
"I’m very new to fitness and have tried the gym but never grew accustomed to it, it always felt like a chore. I’m already in good shape but would like to lose a little of the holiday weight. If i was to do 100 jumping jacks, 100 sit ups and 100 squats a day would I see progress? And if so what area of the body would I see it in?",1
"You would see progress in your ability to do sit-ups, squats and jumping jacks more easily.  In the beginning, all high effort habits feel like a chore.  Over time it becomes second nature and routine.",1
"You'll see more results with a structured program, especially one made with fat loss in mind. Spot reduction is a myth, and it's all about calories in calories out - eating less, moving more, or both. Especially diet, which is actually the bigger piece (eating 200 less calories a day is easier than burning 200 more calories a day).",1
"Is 10 mins of cardio enough at the end of a strength training day? Usually hop on the treadmill at a 15% incline @3.3mph for about 7 or 8 of those minutes, drop to like a 10% @2.6mph for 1 or maybe 2 then go without an incline @ 2.2 mph for a quick HR cooldown. I do want to lose fat, but I get so bored of cardio.",1
Typical strength day is about an hour long following a PPL routine. 6/7 days on the regular. Haven’t trained seriously like I have been the past two months since 2019 when I was in peak performance & can’t remember if I did cardio for longer or not at the end of my days.,1
Thanks in advance.,1
I personally find that dedicated cardio sessions are more effective. I want my heart rate elevated for an extended time to get the most benefit.,1
More anecdote; I do one 40m and one 30m session of cardio a week to supplement my 3-day lifting routine and found my cardio progress to be much better than when I was trying to do 20m at the end of every lifting day.,1
Enough for what? It probably burns like 50 calories if that's important to you.. but as for improving your cardio it's not going to do much.,1
"When I use glute drive, I find it difficult to keep my back on the pad. Whenever I lift my back always comes off the pad (which I understand is incorrect?)",1
How do I make sure my back stays on the pad? Is it just a matter of making the belt tighter? I’m 6’ btw,1
What pad? What lift are you talking about?,1
Of the corporate gyms I've been to I have liked Anytime Fitness the most. They are franchises though so I could just be lucky.,1
“Complete beginner” yet you had a gym membership that recently expired?  Something doesn’t add up here.  🤔.  Sounds to me you paid for a membership and didn’t use it.,1
"I don’t know what your goals are but perhaps a gym setting is not for you. You may need to find an activity that you enjoy and will find it easier to  participate.   Mountain biking, indoor climbing, tennis, badminton, hiking, etc.",1
"It also doesn’t sound like you are motivated as you already have excuses (new year crowds are not as bad as you think).  Motivation is fleeting. You need discipline to hold yourself accountable.  And if that doesn’t work, you need someone else to hold you accountable.",1
"All that to say, PF is the most affordable gym, by far, in my city and is suitable for any beginner to get started.",1
"Probably the best thing to do is to look at the 5 closest gyms in your area and compare them. Price, equipment, hours, bonuses. Among online fitness people almost any gym is more recommended than PF just because PF is so anti-gym culture. But it does have advantages, especially price.",1
"Made a new personal weekly routine and today Sunday(where I live), is my only rest day. I feel completely fine no soreness. Am I not pushing myself hard enough during the training days? Should I just train today because I feel fine or will it lead to overtraining?",1
"You need rest, and won't be sore after every workout or every week. Keep going, see if you are seeing results after a few weeks (or switch to one of the recommended routines, most of them are very well balanced between work and rest).",1
"Soreness isn't a good indicator of progress, you shouldn't judge your workouts on whether or not you're sore. If you're making progress in how much you can lift or adding reps then your training is okay.",1
"Overtraining is unlikely, especially if you're a beginner. Keep in mind that your body repairs itself while you're asleep, if you're not getting enough rest and you're not eating enough to support your training you'll make growth difficult.",1
"Maybe a little discouraged here but what’s the point of doing 10-20 min of exercise a day? I feel like it does nothing except make me feel smelly and gross. When I look at the calories burned it’s like … 60. Big whoop, that’s not even the salad I’m gonna eat for lunch, not counting dressing. Just the salad.",1
"I feel like I’m gonna have to live at the gym, which I hate the thought of, to see any actual improvement. I don’t know enough about this to see it any other way than an uphill struggle. Am I looking at this wrong? I feel like I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. Any help is appreciated.",1
I mean exercising every day is good but it's not really a lot. It'll develop healthy habits and maybe keep your heart a bit healthier but I'm going to go slightly against the grain of the other replied and say it's not going to be that beneficial.,1
"It's better than nothing, don't get me wrong but longer, more focused sessions less often would likely be more beneficial. An hour or so at the gym every other day can gain you immense results, even an hour and a bit three times a week.",1
What are you actual goals?,1
Not exercising at all is how you turn into a person who waits in line to use an escalator when they could walk up a single flight of steps...,1
"Calories are burned through diet, exercise makes a negligible contribution. Exercise doesn't really extend your life, but it makes you less likely to suffer some of the diseases that reduces quality of life as you age.",1
"Depending on your routine there will be a benefit to appearance and general athleticism. Also, having some strength and cardiovascular fitness is useful for a variety of things all through your life.",1
"Assuming it's cardio, heart health and cardiovascular fitness. You can probably run a mile, lots of people out there can't.",1
"In terms of weight loss, that's done on the kitchen, not the gym. Read the wiki for advice",1
"We don't exercise to burn calories, we exercise to make progress towards our fitness goals.",1
"10-20 minutes is still a workout. You're still getting something done, still making progress. If that's all you have time for, you can still use that for one or even two exercises. As far as living in the gym, most gym goers spend less than an hour a day in a gym a few days a week, and make moderate-to-excellent gains.",1
Currently following this PPL split: https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-powerbuilding-split-meal-plan.,1
"During the two PUSH days A & B, I do lateral raises twice; once with dumbbells and once with the cables. I havent done front raises. Would you guys say it's fine based onhthe rest of the workouts? I know the overhead barbell presses target the shoulders too but was wondering if I should also do front raises.",1
"Yeah, I'd personally switch to one of the recommended routines in the wiki, a lot of online routines either have way too many reps, or have exercises that are hard to do correctly/carry risk of injury.",1
"I got called a resolutioner today, because I was logging my reps in my phone between sets.",1
Not my fault you haven’t been here at 3AM for the past month. Not my fault you ain’t see me before.,1
Edit:,1
I thought i posted this in Gym Story Saturday.,1
"I wouldn’t sweat it. People can be judgy this time of year. I do the same (log my reps), and I’ve been going to the gym for years. Data’s fun.",1
This ain't rant wednesday but I'll allow it,1
"F that guy. I log all my workouts. I track changes over months, how else are you supposed to do that?",1
Screw em. I log my sets and reps too because I sometimes have trouble remembering what set I'm on or how many reps with X weight I did the previous workout.,1
"Does anyone have any knowledge about what work outs target what groups of muscle, what muscles there are on the body, and nutritional info?",1
https://exrx.net/,1
And the wiki for this sub,1
"Hey, I rlly got no options and the only times I could workout nextweek are Tuesday upper, Thursday lower, friday upper, and Saturday lower. Is it alright to be able to workout 3 days in a row with no rest or does it hurt my gains?",1
You'll be fine,1
What is a good range of volume in sets for a beginner <6 months on PPL? I’m currently doing 25+ sets per day but my friends all tell me it’s junk volume,1
It depends. 25 hard sets of squats and deadlifts? Probably too much. 25 sets of bicep curls and calf raises? Kinda pointless.,1
I suspect that level of volume means you're probably sacrificing intensity. But you'll need to provide more information to know for sure.,1
"Any android app to track my PHAT routine, along with a list of exercises for each day of the routine?",1
Perseus (formally Personal Training Coach),1
Heavy?,1
Boostcamp has PHAT on it.,1
"I have been listening and reading about people recommending vans and/or converse for lifting (due to flat soles and specially on leg day), I use to do some cardio + lifting so:",1
Should I use running shoes for cardio and flat shoes for lifting? Therefore going to the gym with 2 pairs of shoes,1
"I also have read people who avoid cardio en leg day. So, should I use flats on leg day/ no cardio and running shoes on ""other than leg day"" + cardio?",1
What do you do?,1
I do my harder cardio on leg day specifically to avoid impacting my leg day. Just do it sometime after weights.,1
Big thing for lifting is having little compression so you have a stable footing. People like converse for that. I have some metcon 6's that I use.,1
If you're on a rowing machine or bike you don't need running shoes. But yes if you want to run on a treadmill you're better off bringing two pairs.,1
There's no need to avoid cardio on leg day,1

I have been feeling some tightness and slight pain in my back after heavy deadlifts. For safety reasons- Should I lower the weight? Deadlifting 160 lbs for 5x3+,1
"Context: doing GZCLP for about a month, been lifting for about 6 months. Male, 5’8, 155 lbs Edit: pain is in the lower back.",1
How many reps are you hitting on your 3+ set?,1
You should read the whole wiki,1
"It's only one day, you'll be ok.  Maybe look at how often you're doing this and identify some ways to cut back.  I also ate a bag of hot Taki's once and my god the stomach ache and burning that following was god awful.  I've still never touched another Taki again so you are a champ!",1
eating a lot of junk food is normally correlated to gaining fat cause you can eat a lot of calories without feeling full.  like you found out today.,1
"Gaining fat is a matter of eating too many calories. You can do this while eating entirely healthy things too! If you over eat, you over eat!",1
"So if this bag of chips put you in a calorie surplus today, the technically, yes, you gained some fat. Some fraction of a pound that if you return to your healthier habits tomorrow, you won't even notice.",1
"For the future, realize what you tend to do. For me, I can't keep chips in the house. A family sized bag will be gone by just me because I know they're in my pantry. Now if you can live with them in your pantry, next time, put some in a bowl and leave the bag in the pantry. That way you can more easily limit yourself to a portion.",1
"Also, drinking more water can help these mindless eating phases. Have a water bottle near you so you can mindlessly sip on water rather than food",1
"If eating that bag of chips put you into a calorie surplus then yes you will gain some fat. But the amount of fat you would gain from a single bag of chips is negligible. Also, if you just ate slightly less the next day it balances out.",1
"Protein sparing modified fast, read Lyle McDonald's rapid fat loss handbook. A week is a bit late, but you might drop 2-3lbs of water & maybe 0.5-1lb of fat if you follow the diet as it's laid out.",1
"Exercise: As much walking as you can tolerate/your schedule allows. Perhaps 1 or 2 full body weight training sessions, but they will have minimal effect in 1 week.",1
In a week? Nothing.,1
"In a week there isn't much you can do. But reducing carbs and salt will lead to a drop in water weight and less bloating, which should make you feel leaner.",1
Nothing you do in a week will have a noticeable impact on your appearance.,1
F.ex this random guy says strength is not correlated to size and you shouldnt train like a powerlifter,1
Lulz.,1
"Aight, first up, the terms beginner/intermediate/advanced are a little bit of a misnomer and not what you see in other fields.",1
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE INTERMEDIATE OR ADVANCED.,1
These terms are only meant to indicate the degree to which your training must be a giant pain in the ass in order to progress.,1
"If you are able to run a beginner linear progression program to its end (i.e. you no longer get 3x5 or whatever), deload, restart the progression and run it to a reasonably higher place than last time, then you don't have to change anything! It's fine! Keep running that shit.",1
"If you want to start adding some skill work, by all means start doing it on off days or at the beginning of your workouts. Make sure to start low on volume and accumulate slowly but steadily.",1
"so take a look at the world record power lifters.  are they small?  take a look at just big lifters around here.  are they small?  the answer is no.  there is truth to a difference between training for absolute strength and hypertrophy but the line is blurry. If you're looking to get big you can do the big lifts in a greater rep range and you'll be served well.  5/3/1 BBB is a tried and true hypertrophy program mainly involving big lifts.  stronger by science has barbell based hypertrophy programs.  also plenty of people have gotten big doing bro splits too.  more than one way to get big, just do whatever you'd rather do at the end of the day.  and if that turns out not to work you have other options.",1
Should I still just focus on heavy compound lifts?,1
"Many of the heavy compound barbell exercises are good lifts for hypertrophy. They aren't necessary, but they are fairly good choices.",1
"However, you shouldn't only do those lifts heavy lifts, as there are other lifts that you should also be doing for bodybuilding/hypertrophy. A simple example is bicep curls. You need to be doing those if you care about bodybuilding. But there is no reason you can't do barbell squats and bicep curls in the same program.",1
"For rep ranges let’s say I use the 8-10 rep range on a lift for 4 sets, do you wait until you can get 10 reps on all 4 sets, or do you increase if you get something like 10,10,9,8 reps",1
"Your programme should specify this, but as a general rule I'd expect you to increase once you can hit 10 for all sets",1
"It is really up to you.  Ypu would probaby be better off incorporating RPE instead of straight sets if you are able.  If you are using RPE or RIR your sets would likely be closer to 10, 10, 9, 8.",1
"You have two options for progressing a lift throigh straight sets.  Add weight or add a rep.  So you could go 4x8 one session and then add 5lbs and do 4x8.  Or you could do 4x8, next session 4x9 at the same weight and then 4x10.  If I were able to do 10, 10, 9, 8, I'd try 4x8 of the next weight.",1
Bet a better option is to choose a good program that will tell you when to increase reps or weight.,1
10 for all 4,1
On 531 is it often that you’ll have to recalculate your tm after test weeks rather than being able to just keep going up in weight ?,1
"I've checked my 1RM once in 7 cycles and that was only as a competition with my brother. Otherwise, if you fail to get 5, 3, or 1 rep on your AMRAP sets then lower your TM and if you get 10+ reps on your 1+ set increase your TM by 10lbs for bench/OHP and 15-20lbs for squat/DL.",1
Shouldn’t be often. You’re expected to start with a light enough training max that you can keep progressing for awhile,1
How much does ‘water retention’ play in massive weight gain over the holiday season?,1
I mean surely I was in a caloric surplus and didn’t workout but a 4 kg weight gain in 3 and a half weeks seems like madness (and I did a half marathon in between this 3 and a half weeks where I didn’t weight myself) What should I do or eat so I can weigh myself and assess my actual weight gain or is this it,1
"If your weight is consistent for a week or two, that is your actual weight.",1
How much creative should I be taking as a 5’10” male at 250lbs (34% body fat)?,1
"I currently take 7.5g a day, and I’m wondering if I should do less or more.",1

"Not an expert, but I know the amount of creatine you take depends on whether if you are in the loading phase. Some like Kre alkalyn require no loading at all, and you should definitely keep well hydrated when taking creatine supplements.",1
just take 5g a day forever,1
"Max 5g a day unless you've just started taking creatine and are ""creatine loading"". More isn't necessarily better with creatine and having too much will just make you feel bloated and give you the shits.",1
Can anyone recommend me a list or a link of the best stretches one should do before and after weightlifting?,1
"Stretch after, if you find stretching makes you feel better. Generally speaking you don't do static stretching before lifting as it may pre-fatigue the muscles. Think more in the manner of dynamic stretching, or mobility warmups, like MBSC's Flow Warmup, or the Wenning Warmup. To free up hips, free up shoulders, and to literally get warmth in your joints.",1
"I will throw in my $0.02 that stretching should be done if you want to increase flexibility, but that it isn't otherwise necessary or helpful to do before or after weightlifting. There isn't evidence that stretching before or after lifting weights or doing other physical activity does anything to prevent injury or soreness.",1
So stretch if you enjoy or want to improve flexibility.,1
I've been hitting chest twice a week now with:3x8 bench press3x10 dumbell bench press3x10 dumbell inclined bench press3x10 cable fly3x8 dips,1
is that too much volume for chest growth? I've been training consistently for about 8 months,1
"Aim for 10-20 sets pr muscle group. Once you've done enough work to elicit a growth response, anything beyond that is just giving you more to recover from.",1
What did you weigh 8 months ago and what do you weigh now?,1
What sort of progress have you seen?,1
"You could probably be more efficient by cutting half the exercises and loading more weight on the ones that you keep, but if you're seeing good progress, then who am I to stop you?",1
"It's not what you do It's how you do it. Are you focusing on ""feeling the muscle contract"" on every rep or are you just chucking the weights around?",1
"Also in general it is good to mix it up every few months. ""Surprising"" your muscles is what makes them grow, as they build muscle fibers to adjust to the change.",1
"I'd personally lower the volume, if i am doing push twice a week, I'll do 2 chest, 2 shoulder and 2 tricep exercises in each session. Then next session in that week I'll do the same number of exercises for each muscle group but with different exercises.",1
"I'll keep going with that for let's say 3 or 4 months. After which I either change the exercises or change how I do them (eg. Instead of doing Bench press for 8 to 10 reps I will increase the weight and aim for 3 to 5 reps), it's different so my muscle grows to accommodate.",1
Hope this helped :),1
Do you have big chest,1
"Anything that advertises a flat stomach, taking inches off your waist, etc is content to be avoided.",1
"Getting a flat stomach comes from losing weight but may have to be combined with building up some muscle as well. If you are overweight, losing weight and getting to a healthy weight should be your first goal. However, if you are getting lean for your height, and still not getting that flat stomach, then don't try and keep losing weight. If you do manage to lose enough weight for a flat stomach, you may end up quite underweight.",1
"So once you're at a healthy weight, building muscle is gonna be key. (You should start trying to build muscle from day 1 when trying to lose weight though). Muscle on your body is healthy! Don't just try and target certain areas, work out full body! Lift heavy (once you are able to get a gym membership). I'm assuming you're also a woman.... If I'm correct, please realize we don't bulk up like men and it is NOT quick.",1
"My own personal journey: I dieted down to a healthy 135lbs. Still had a belly pouch. Started lifting heavy and built significant muscle (and was trying to become visibly muscular, still got a ways to go). I went up to about 145lbs. From there, I dieted back down to 135 for a totally different looking body with a mostly flat stomach and a very athletic, fit look. Not a bulky look at all.",1
"So if you don't have access to a gym, look into r/bodyweightfitness and another option is to look into something like TRX, using your body weight as resistant and can give you a killer workout!",1
In general to get a smaller waist you want to do cardio and improve your diet so as to increase your metabolism and decrease body fat percentage.,1
Many YouTube videos regarding workouts for a smaller waist will show some generic 30 minute home ab workout which is pointless if there's still enough body fat to hide the abs.,1
"I'd recommend doing couch to 5k (app) to start up with running and also following yoga with adriene (youtube) and start doing yoga. The best way to get fit and ""look better"" is to actually enjoy working out to begin with. These channels will help to get you started into fitness, from there follow channels focused around nutrition and healthy eating and you'll be off to a good start!",1
"A flatter stomach will depend on your body fat %. Exercise will help, and ab exercises will help your abs show, but the most important contributor to reducing fat is to cut your calories. You can't spot reduce fat, and your body will determine where the fat is cut from.",1
"No, exercises do not shape your stomach. (They don't really make it wider either, that's like 90% myth.)",1
"The only way to lose weight from your stomach is to lose it from everywhere. Caveat that if you're already skinny, gaining muscle may be be more effective than losing weight in giving you a shape you're happy with.",1
Here's the FAQ on getting a flat belly:,1
https://thefitness.wiki/faq/how-can-i-get-a-six-pack-flat-stomach-toned-abs/,1
I personally think it's fine.  rows are rows.  I personally only do chinups and inverted rows for back because I like them way more than other stuff. and feel free to add more volume in whatever way you want.  experiment with what you like!,1
"From your comment regarding your lower back, I'd say you'd be better off doing chest supported t bar rows, or doing dumbbell bent over rows, as you can still do the explosive movement from the floor but you don't stress the back as much.",1
I wouldn’t say inverted rows are a sub for barbell rows. Generally inverted rows are used as a secondary accessory.,1
Is there a reason you can’t/don’t want to do barbell rows?,1
Is getting one of my calves to 17 inches a realistic goal within a year if I've only been only been training them for about 3 months?,1
My left calf is about 16 & a half and my right one is pretty much 16 exactly. My current height and weight is 5'11 166 LBs this morning.,1
I'm not going to stop bulking anytime soon because I still look pretty skinny going to aim for around 180 at a slow pace before considering if I should cut or not.,1
"Extreme volume really helps calf growth, but unfortunately a huge factor with calves is genetics. So potentially you could, but you really need to excessively over-train them if that’s your goal.",1
"Anecdotal evidence, but I squat >4 plate and my calves really haven’t gotten that much bigger compared to before I started lifting years ago.",1
Anyones Apple Watch ever not register their ‘move’ totals properly?,1
Mines logged that I did a 900kj indoor cycle this morning and then 2600kj strength workout… for a total ‘move’ total on my circles of 1900kj??,1
"If it's a tech problem, r/applewatch and r/AppleWatchFitness might have more info.",1
It doesn’t particularly matter either way. The initial estimates are likely to be so inaccurate that it’s not really relevant if it adds them correctly.,1
Does it matter when I eat my protein throughout the day? Like if I eat my  .8 g/lb of body weight before lifting would I still need to eat protein after for muscle recovery or would my body just use the protein from a couple of hours ago,1
You would want to try and distribute you protein across 3-5 feedings 4-6 hours apart if possible.  But hitting your daily protein goal is more important than timing or spacing.,1
"According to this paper from Schoenfeld et al, if your post-exercise and pre-exercise meals are about 6 hours apart, you don't have to add a pre- or post-workout meal in between them.",1
It doesn't matter.  Just make sure you get enough each day.,1
"I (F) used to work out quite a lot over the summer but got out of it due to going to uni and no longer having weights at home due to being in a dorm room. I would do weighted YT workouts like caroline girvans etc and focused my diet in a calorie deficit with more protein but working out made me feel very awful and tired, more-so as the summer went on. I kept going because I enjoyed it. I want to keep working on in my dorm room this uni term with body weight exercises, does anyone have any advice for routines or youtubers that are doable with bodyweight only and dont make me feel worse?",1
"I'd really consider going to your uni gym if possible, a lot of them are really nice and you're paying for it",1
"It made you feel awful and tired, but you enjoyed it? Can you explain this a little? I'm not sure what to recommend without understanding what exactly was going wrong.",1
"By the way, r/bodyweightfitness has a couple routines that don't require weights, although some of the moves require a pullup bar or rings.",1
"Most universities have a gym students can access.  I'd ask around for sure.  Failing that, there are plenty of bodyweight routines that popped up on YT during the pandemic.",1
Men's Shorts Recs?,1
"Not really sure where to post this, but I'm primarily a runner and small (5' 8.5""). Anyway, because of this, I started buying my shorts with a 5"" inseam, because it's what I prefer for running. Anyway, for working out in the gym, I discovered years ago that I really like shorts with both pockets (for keys, phone, etc., especially getting to and from gym) and also a longer liner so that when I do abs or other exercises where my legs are in the air, nobody is subjected to my junk. I used to buy the Nike Flex Stride 2-in-1s or whatever they were called, but this seems to be getting phased out, and I can't seem to find a replacement. Nobody seems to want this style of short, and the standard at every company now seems to be 7"" or else 9"". Should I switch to the industry standard? Is this what everyone else wears? I've never tried a 7"" inseam before, but I just feel like I would drown in them due to my slight frame.",1
"What do y'all think? Do most people, including smaller guys, wear 7"" inseams?",1
"What lined shorts do y'all like in general? Does anybody know of any good ones that have pockets, liners, and a 5"" inseam?",1
"there are so many good 5"" lined shorts.  chubbies made their name on these.  ten thousand is often recommended.  REI has a bunch.  also a lot of Amazon brands are fine and much cheaper",1
I wear boxer briefs with the Raskol bodybuilding shorts. Protects the junk and lets me have 3 inch inseams.,1

"If you assume the body can gain 0.5lbs of muscle each week. And 0.5lbs of muscle takes 1,400 excess calories to build, if you ate exactly at maintenance calories, would your body lose 0.4lbs of fat each week? (3,500 calories per lb of fat, so 1,400 = 0.4lbs). If so, at what BF% would this slow?",1
We don't know. There isn't a study which can control those variables well enough to give us evidence either way. Realistically there is probably enough interpersonal variables which make any broad statement on this pointless.,1
"If those assumptions are true, yes.",1
I doubt it works out that cleanly in the real world though,1
"Your assumptions are bad. Recomposition is possible, sure, but it's tediously slow. Like, insanely slow. Like you can bulk or cut over 6 months and a recomp will take 18-24 months for the same results.",1
Not sure what to make of this...,1
"Went to the gym intending a cardio session, put the bike on the target heart rate zone setting (145bpm), and the bike is meant to adjust resistance so you reach that rate (you probably all know that). Got going, went for an hour, 42.5km later my average heart rate was 118bpm (cross-checked with my Fitbit). Just could not get my heart rate up without going crazy and risking an injury.",1
"Does anyone else have days where this happens? I smashed it in terms of speed and distance for me, so wondered whether 1) I've reached another level 2) my legs were too tired to get the heart pumping or 3) bike was broken.",1
I tacked on a weight session at the end of it (I felt ripped off!) and felt really good the whole way through so not sure it's my legs as the issue.,1
"I'll take the 1500 calories but would've liked the time in the target heart rate zone as well hahaha - love your thoughts on why my heart didn't get going (my average resting heart rate is 45bpm, not sure if that matters, and I've lost almost 20kg in about 9 months, so there's some level of fitness there).",1
"How did it feel, compared to the days you stay at 145? If 118 today felt harder than 145 normally, my money would be on a tech issue.",1
Sometimes you have amazing days.,1

"When transitioning from an specific exercise, to another exercises that targets the same muscle(s), how long do you rest in between?",1
"I just treat it as another set, so about 2-3 minutes depending on the exercise.",1
"Most of the time, re-racking weights, cleaning up and then walking over to the next piece of equipment and setting up everything takes longer than whatever rest I actually need.",1
"As a baseline, use the amount of rest you need between sets at that point of your workout.",1
"Almost none. Longest would be from like, a bench press to a deadlift.",1
Even going from bench to a squat doesn't take as many warm-up sets because I'm already prepared to be pushing myself.,1
As long as it takes to set up/walk to the next piece of equipment. Don’t overthink it… if you go heavy rest a bit longer,1
"No individual workout is particularly “useful”; it’s a cumulative effort over time. Just keep going consistently with the best program you can manage, improving iteratively",1

"Neutral curls. Ideally a curl machine, for more even tension, but dumbbells are fine.",1
This would be a good question for your doctor or physio.,1
"Just looking for a general consensus here. Usually I subsribe to the ""mind your own business, never give unsolicited advice"" philosophy. I've seen some people do some pretty stupid stuff at my gym but just ignored it and carried on with my workout. Today that was tested a bit. There was a girl deadlifting 70kg on the platform next to me whos back looked like an inverted letter U. She was basically folded in half. It was painful to watch, and she was doing multiple sets like this. There was a serious injury undoubtedly on the way",1
"So, is it ever ok to step in and give some pointers to strangers?",1
"If you are truly concerned for her then there are def ways to address it, IMO. I would say as long as you take a friendly approach you should be fine.",1
"If she is really that shitty, form-wise, then it’s likely she’s still new. So maybe if you approached her after a set and said something as simple as “nice, strong lift” she might be like “oh really, I just started, I don’t even know if I’m doing it right, blah blah blah” because people can be pretty self conscious. Since you approached with a compliment now she’s possibly open to talk. That’s when you can be like, “oh yeah, you’re already doing well. If you want I could give you a few pointers on form” and then just be helpful from there.",1
But there are a million different ways it can go. Ya never know.,1
i personally would never say anything unless they are doing something that might hurt others around them. not my job to keep people from hurting themselves,1
No.,1
okay i don’t know if this appropriate here but i haven’t found answers.,1
my callouses are crazy and they hurt like a motherfucker from my excessive farmer walks.,1
do i use a different grip or do i simply just endure the pain of them? my last back day it made it almost impossible to lift 225 off the ground so i’m very indecisive on what i should be changing.,1
The pain is probably caused by the handles slipping down your hand.,1
"You can either grip them lower in your hand, so they can't slip much more and you can use chalk to reduce additional slippage.",1
get a callus scraper and shave them down every few weeks or so,1
you could use straps,1
Straps on a farmers walk?,1
Dosnt that defeat the entire purpose of the farmers walk?,1
"no?  it doesnt have to be a grip exercise.  farmers walk engages a large portion of your body, it would still be great for you with straps",1
It defeats part of the purpose of it.,1
"If they aren’t training for strongman then they can still get the benefits of moving with a heavy load. If they are training for strongman then yes, farmers with straps is dumb.",1
Ideally it would performed without straps either way because a strong grip makes for a strong person.,1
"200g of protein a day for a 96 Kg male. Been working out for a year and a half now. Is it worth it, to ingest that much protein I mean?",1
The stronger by science guys have recently been talking about how 1.3-1.6g/kg gets you the majority of the benefits. 1.6-2.2 is probably the optimal range.,1
Personally I'm usually at around 1.5 and I've been happy with my progress. Increasing my overall calories has been more effective at increasing my gains.,1
"If you’re making gains and are okay with eating that amount, then yes it’s worth it.",1
Not necessarily,1

"How do I know if I have a strain or just DOMS? Sounds like a dumb question but I haven’t worked out for a bit over two weeks and decided to hit chest. Everything went well, had lost a bit of strength but not anything else worth mentioning. Three days later I hit upper body again and when I started benching my left pec felt like it had a strain in it. The warmup sets hurt like a bitch but I pushed through it, then after my first rep on the first set i re-racked and quit because it hurt so badly.",1
Do you think I just trained too hard after coming back and therefore have bad DOMS or is it some kind of injury? And what is ”enough” warmup before benching?,1
DOMS shouldn’t hurt like that. Sounds like you might’ve injured yourself. I’d check your form.,1
"Nobody here will (or should) give you a medical advice. If you are worried that you injured yourself, visit a doctor.",1

"They cite people like Drew Baye and Dr. Doug McGuffey. The whole thing seems like bunk to me, but y'all have any thoughts?",1
Yeah they're wrong.,1
It depends on what programs you're comparing.  Is it as/nearly as effective as what most people do in the gym?  Probably if you're getting a good amount of volume and spending 4 hours in the gym.,1
"Is it as/nearly as effective as a good program?  No, a good program has a lot more volume and progression.",1
"Given that they're only working out for 20-40 mins a week, I'd agree.",1
Given that they're only working out for 20-40 mins a week,1
I think people tend to find evidence that supports their already existing biases/beliefs rather than base their beliefs off evidence.,1

"The issue is... I m afraid I m losing whatever little embryo of a muscle I have. I have a smart scale, it says I went from 28% body fat to 26.6% body fat.",1
"I plan on cutting till probably 75kg (165lbs). But if I continue like this, based on the smart scale figures, I might reach 20% bodyfat at best by then...",1
What should I do? Increasing the weight at the gym any further leads to failure.,1
"Those scales are not accurate. If your lifts are progressing, you're not losing muscle.",1
"Those scales aren't an accurate (or consistent) reading of bf%.  But so long as you're getting enough protein (which it sounds like you are) and working out, your body will prioritize fat loss over muscle.",1
"I picked up an inexpensive spin bike, and it hurts my feet. I watched some tutorials on proper foot placement and switched to a harder ""skate"" type shoe that I had kicking around, but my feet are still getting tingly and hurting.",1

"On front squats I've noticed I manage much better (chest more up) with a mid - wide stance, am I still targeting my quads like I intend to?",1
Does resting between sets for TOO long hurt hypertrophy?,1
"The information I can find online mostly seems to say longer is better if it allows you to recover better between sets. But what about really long, like 45min？I work from home and also workout at home, so just wanna explore the idea of putting in sets when I'm taking short breaks from work during the day.",1
"The problem is that you cool down after such a long rest, so you would need to warm up again to do a hard set. I personally find warming up to be important for me, and wouldn't want to come in after a 45 minute break and immediately do a hard set with heavy weights.",1
"Most of the time, when people talk about long rests between sets, they mean 5-15 minutes. I'm not sure if you will find any study about 45 minutes rest.",1
"The problem is that your body will cool down in that rest period, requiring you to warmup again (and again). A warmup isn't just to reduce the risk of injury, it also increases the body temperature to increase your performance. Hence, less performance = less hypertrophy.",1
It also depends on the type of workout you are doing.,1
Heavy deadlifts? Never cold.,1
Bodyweight pushups? Could probably work.,1
well tbh probably not but from a practicality stand point doing single sets with 45 min breaks means you'll probably have to warm up again,1
"In my opinion reducing the work you're doing would be a bad idea. Especially during a cut your minimum effective volume is a tad higher than when you are in a surplus, which means if anything you need to start with more volume in order to maintain your muscle mass.",1
"I have a question on Jeff Nippard's Fundamental Hypertrophy program. When an exercise is prescribed e.g. as 3x6 @ RPE = 7, does it mean that all sets should be RPE = 7 or only the first (or last?) set? In the former case am I supposed to adjust weights between sets (as otherwise the RPE will naturally go up in later sets)? Am I overthinking it?",1
RPE 7 should stay roughly RPE 7 for all sets.,1
"I’ve run JN’s programs, PPL, U/L, and full body and had good strength and size gains from them.",1
I always took his RPE goals to mean “last set RPE” so 100% had to hit that RPE on the last set. In the sets leading up I would say it depends. So I’ll give a number of examples with the assumption of 3 sets,1
"If the goal is RPE 7, then there should be no issue getting all 3 sets to RPE 7 IMHO.",1
"Goal of RPE 8 you can do 7, 8, 8 if you want to keep the same number of reps. Or you can do 8, 8, 8 but that last set you probably will hit 1 or 2 fewer reps depending on what exercise it is.",1
"RPE 9, do 8, 8, 9  or 9, 9, 9 but I would expect that the reps achieved would drop quite a bit on the last set, maybe even 1 or 2 on the second set as well.",1
"And so on, you can just do what you like and make sure you’re at least RPE 7 on every set. However this is for bigger compound movements. If he is recommending say RPE 10 for dumbbell curls, then I would go 10 on every set and just allow the reps to be what they are.",1
"This makes sense, thank you.",1
"Around 11-12% bf, thinking about doing a minicut (like 6 weeks max.) to get shredded before an event ( not a contest) i'm preparing, then going into maintenance again or at a slight deficit",1
"Do you suggest to go hard, like 7000 weekly deficit, or soft, more like 3500?",1
"Hunger is not a problem, only things I care about are max possible results and not losing ( so much) strenght, otherwise anything is ok for me",1
"The leaner your starting point the less aggressive of a deficit you should shoot for if you care about retaining lean mass. 7000 a week is ~2lbs of tissue loss a week, which is definitely on the high/aggressive end of things. Something else to think about is if you push really hard into this event, will your eating be a total free for all at the event and erase a lot of your progress? I personally would go for a more chill deficit, closer to the 3500 weekly, and be confident I'm not going to lose lean mass, and am going to keep my progress after the cut's done.",1
Thanks a lot,1
"Yeah, going all in it's pretty hard but I wanna test how extreme I can push myself in this ( within safe and effective limits) without any significant drawback",1
"No risk of overeating, it's not a food related event and I have no chance of binging after or around this, too, so don't worry",1
My self control is pretty well developed,1
"If your goal is to lose as much fat as possible and you don't struggle with hunger, go ahead and go with the harsher deficit. That's kind of the point of a minicut, that you go for a deficit that is long-term not sustainable, but for a month or so is manageable; and if you meet your macros and micros, you shouldn't even lose too much of your muscle mass.",1
"Yes, I mantained a slight surplus of 500 calories over maintenance for a couple months, like 3-4 to just bulk up a little, now I feel like I have reached the point I wanted, and wanna go shredded again asap without going overboard with enthusiasm, ending up feeling and looking like shit",1
"During holidays I had too many events etc. And i'm feeling in shitty shape, so it's the moment to use the rapid clean up emergency button lol",1
"Is a hip thrust with a barbell more effective than with a dumbbell of the same weight? If so, why?",1
"No, it is roughly the same. The only benefit is it is easier to adjust the weight of a barbell and get it into position.",1
"Nope, but personally barbells are easier to manage.",1
How do you brace for higher rep leg exercises?,1
I find I’m bracing while I’m performing the movement e.g. as I’m descending into the squat or the lunge rather than before. This especially applies for unilateral exercises.,1
Is that worse than properly bracing each time at the top?,1
"You don't need to rebrace every rep, but when you do it's better to get it locked in between reps",1
"Is there a program/routine that I can only do with dumbbells and a cable machine? My apartment gym has a dumbbell set, leg extension/curl, cable machine, and a smith machine. I heard that sbd is bad on a smith machine because it messes up the bar path so I'm trying to avoid it.",1
I do muay thai as my cardio on mon-thurs and was planning to do weights on MWF. Is there a suitable routine for me considering I'm between beginner-intermediate? (I've done some lifting in the past but only in 2-3 months max intervals),1
What to do if the bar cannot sit on the back muscles for squatting?,1
"I am getting into weight lifting, but one of the things I can't do with the bar is rest it on the back muscles where it should be. My arms can stretch back that far, and if I do, I force it, and it hurts my shoulders and arms.",1
Is there a stretch or practice I need to do in order to rest the bar correctly?,1
Post a form check? You're probably not placing the bar or your hands in the right place.,1
"Try holding the bar just past shoulder width,  pinch your shoulder blades together and move under the bar, pinching your shoulders should give a little platform to place the bar and enable your hands and arms to be in front of your shoulders as they're pushed back. You might find that more comfortable",1
Did you try high bar and low bar grip?,1
Is it worth/necessary to add an arm day to my split? I always feel too exhausted to do much when I actually reach arms on my push or pull days.,1
"I’m running push/pull (not legs), so training 4 times a week. Would adding an arm/shoulder day at the end of the week be a good idea, or will my arms already have enough stimulus from back and chest exercises?",1
"I would definitely workout my arms more if i were u, unless... do you just want toned arms and not going for much mass? Also do you not train legs?",1
Dumb question but how do you motivate yourself to get up early to go to gym?,1
My work gym is now really busy during the week but opens from 6am when I think it may be quieter. I have woken up at 6am every day but struggled to get out of bed.,1
"you get used to it.  set your clothes out the night before, hop right out of bed and get out the door.  also if 6 was a big jump for you, you could consider winding back slower.  my day starts at 330 but for years it was 630, then 6, then 530, 5.. you get the picture.  gotta go to bed earlier too.  if you arent getting your 7-8 hrs of course youre gona drag in the morning",1
"You just have to do it without thinking. Get everything you need for the gym laid out before you go to bed, wake up, get changed, get out the door as quick as possible",1
If getting out of bed is the problem start setting your alarm in a place you have physically get up to go and turn off,1
Eventually it'll become a habit and you'll never look back,1
"It's a pretty simple concept, if you want to wake up early, go to bed early. Go to bed at 9pm.",1
"Hello people, I am 15 years old and I have a 23.4 BMI, how could I lower that percentage, what should I do? exercises that can be done at home please",1
"BMI is not a percentage. It is just a number that is calculated using your weight and height. 23.4 is in the ""normal"" range. The way to lower BMI is to either increase your height or decrease your weight.",1
"read the wiki, pick a beginner strength routine and do light cardio 3x a week. learn about dieting for fat loss (in the wiki) and do that.",1
"You don't need to lower your BMI. BMI is a flawed way of measuring weight. Also, 23 isn't even ""overweight"" by standard BMI measurements.",1
In the last 2 years my BMI has gone up because I exercise ~5 times a week and have built muscle.,1
What you should start doing is build a routine. There is a great book called Atomic Habits and I used the strategy to start my workout routine. The summary of the book is this:,1
"Start as small as humanly possible, but do it every day. 1 push up done every day for 30 days will help you more than 30 push ups in 1 day. Build the habit to the point where you don't think about it. Once you have the startings of a habit, slowly, and I mean slowly, start making it harder.",1
"The goal should be to get to a point where your brain isn't fighting anymore. The reason why habits are hard to form is because making decisions is energy intensive and your brain has been evolutionarily designed to prevent that. Once you have the neurons rewired in your brain, it becomes so much easier to stick to a habit. I broke my habit for a month earlier this year because I was busy with work. My body was starting to crave working out again because of those habit neurons.",1
"As well, try and make the exercise part of your identity. If you are going through the motions of being active it won't be as motivating as believing you are an active person. This is a psychological thing, but it is so effective.",1
"Also, don't beat yourself up over not doing it for a few days. Things like streaks are a double edged sword because once you break them, you don't want to continue.",1
Hope this helps!,1
Covid absolutely destroyed me and I haven’t even looked at a weight in over 2 weeks. Diet has been abysmal. Should I drop the volume on my first session back or only the weight?,1
"Totally your preference, I prefer maintaining volume over weight",1
Which exercise is a better squat accessory: hack squat or belt squat?,1
"Also, which one is more lower back friendly?",1

"Whichever one you prefer, really.",1
"Also, which one is more lower back friendly?",1
Belt squat.,1
"Hopefully a relatively simple question lol. I'd like to add stretches into my routine, but when should I add them? Currently I do cardio in the mornings 5 days a week and lifting at night 4 days a week. I'd like to increase/restore some flexibility as I can definitely tell I've lost some lol. What kinds of stretches should I do? Should I go full yoga or just some simple movements?",1
"i take a yoga class once a week on my rest day.  has exceeded all of my deep stretching needs, i recommend it to anyone who comes anywhere close to asking",1
So I started with a new online coach this week. He said ideally he'd like to see at least one set of everything. I'm used to filming only max attempts and occasional form checks if I'm feeling off. What do you all think of people walking around with tripods? I certainly don't look like an influencer so I'm hoping I'm not making others uncomfortable thinking they're gonna end up on the 'gram or something. I work out early AM so there's usually only like 2-3 other people around,1
It's pretty obvious when someone is filming themselves in a public gym for training purposes instead of clout chasing. Just be courteous and try not to angle the videos where other people are in the shot if possible.,1
"I wouldn't worry about what other people think, although I'd be courteous about trying to only film yourself since you're in a public gym.",1
"Hey guys, newbie here. I'm 16 and have worked out twice before with a friend recently and have gotten this advice from a friend, however he told me I could approach a couple things in multiple ways. I plan on going 3 times a week. I also run 3x5km (or 30m) a week if that matters.",1
For the actual questions:,1
Does it matter if I do a full body routine over a specific part each day?,1
Is the list correct as to what exercises fit a certain group of muscle? Anything I should add?,1
How many things of the list should I be doing if I do a full body?,1
Thanks in advance!,1

There are a lot of good training programs in the wiki which I think would be great for you to check out,1
"If only going 3 days per week, training full body would make sense.",1
Check out the wiki linked above.  The basic beginner program would work well;,1

I've anterior pelvic tilt and hip flexion from sitting long hours.,1

Why would DLs or squats be unsafe for you?,1
"Probably dumb question, but by mixing whey and oats and putting it in the fridge for 2 or 3 days, nothing in the whey protein is destructed, right?",1
right,1
"Is it possible to be in a calorie deficit and still not lose any weight? If im correct, a 220 pound man like myself should be eating around 2500-3000 calories to maintain weight. I've started tracking my calories recently and unless im bad at math i dont even think i eat more than 2000 calories most days, so how is it possible I've been around 220 pounds for 2 years straight now?",1
You're eating more calories than that or your daily calorific expenditure is lower than you think,1
"If i add up all my calories i eat in a day based on labels on the back of my food, is it possible that it adds up to 2000 but is actually much more than that? In other words can i trust the labels?",1
There'll be some margin for error but over time that'll cancel itself out. It's definitely possible your daily energy expenditure is less than 2000 calories if you aren't very active.,1
"Might also be worth checking the calorie count per serving size, it can be easy to get caught out by that.",1
Should be pretty accurate.,1
Are you weighing everything and writing it down too? No estimations anywhere? Have you been doing this consistently on all days for more than two weeks?,1
"One cheat day a week can easily cancel multiple days' progress,  that I would also keep in mind.",1
"Honestly I'd guess if you're always exactly hitting 2000 kcal and counting correctly, you should be losing weight at 220 lbs even if rather sedentary (still it's good to get moving of course). Except if you are both very sedentary and female. But it may take some time to show up on the scale (if your actual TDEE is 2200 kcal then that's less than 0.5 lbs per week lost)",1
"Weigh yourself daily but ignore day-to-day fluctuations, only trends (e.g. 7 day running average) are helpful.",1
Thats not possible. If you are in a consistent deficit you WILL lose weight. If you arent losing and you arent gaining then you are at maintenance. You should use a calorie counting app and log all your food for a week or two and see where you are at.,1
"If you want to get in a deficit, just keep lowering your calories slowly daily until you start losing weight. Then you will know that what you ate before was your maintenance, and now you will know your deficit.",1
Weight loss/gain is literally just adding or subtracting calories/exercise. Its extremely simple when you actually find those values.,1
"No. If you're not losing weight, you're not in a deficit. It's that simple.",1
Usually it's that simple yes. But underlying health issues also could effect your metabolic health/state.,1
"Question -> I always did fullbody workouts. It was great, but i wanted to try PPL now. I have always have will to go workout even if its everyday, but lets be honest, time and other things, its not always possible. What is better to do if i skip pull for example. Should i add that pull routine into my push routine the next day, or just skip it ? How this works ? Ty",1
"Cant you just do Pull the next time your in the gym? Just continue PPL, regardles if you train 6 times a week, or 4 times.",1
"Just pick a program that works for the time you have available, PHUL for example is a 4 day program",1
Hey! I hope everyone is doing good in here.,1
"I gained some weight these past few months and I'm looking to start intermittent fasting to lose it again. The reason I'm choosing fasting over other alternatives is because it has worked wonders for me in the past: basically, I take a light breakfast (coffee with no sugar and a snack) a normal lunch (without thinking twice about the number of calories) and I don't eat again until the next morning. This is what I'm planning to do this time as well.",1
"However,",1
"I also want to start running 3 times a week like I used to in the past (to improve my overall fitness level, nothing to do with losing weight). So I'm looking for advice into how to combine both running and fasting.",1
Should I run in the morning or will my sugar level be too low?,1
Should I run before sleep instead?,1
These are the two options I can think of - I work 9 to 7 on weekdays.,1
Is there a way to combine them without risk? Looking to get your precious advice. Thank you!!,1
VLC diets work wonders because you end up in a big deficit. And then you stop doing it and you go back to old habits and you gain the weight back.,1

Does the 12-3-30 workout make your legs bigger or smaller?,1
There is no exercise that makes the legs smaller. To make your legs smaller you should lose weight. This is done by achieving a calorie deficit. Read this: https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/,1
If you eat enough your legs will get a little bigger and if you cut enough calories your legs will get a little smaller,1

Eating less.,1
"What are some foods that might make you retain fat in a weird way as your body’s reaction to their consumption? Even if i lose weight my body holds on to fat and it just makes me look small and weird. I put a lot of work in the gym and i hit my protein daily and eat pretty healthy but im starting to think theres something my body doesnt like. I eat pretty much the same foods every single day (could this be the reason?) and im not picky with anything. But mainly eggs, canned tuna, lots of chicken, lean ham, milk, cheese, potatoes, cereal and veggies",1
"Based on your post history, your biggest issue is a lack of discipline in your eating habits.",1

Day 6 - Cardio and Abs (same as day 3),1
"The next day I start over, so technically no rest days. I count my cardio/ab day as a rest day for the rest of my body and I feel fine, definitely seeing progress. I’ve been doing this for about two months, going strong. Last year I did a similar routine for about 3 months, then I stopped after some major life changes. Back on track now and feeling better than ever, just want some critiques/advice from people with more experience than me. I appreciate any input.",1
"Increase your caloric intake if you can, I understand you have low appetite but a little extra can always be done. And your workout routine is not bad, important question is whether you enjoy it, because I would hate routine like this but that's subjective. Objectively it is not bad workout structure. You can maybe alternate between back and chest on upper body day instead of doing one after the other but it's up to you. Most important is working hard in these sessions. And if you feel like you are making good progress without rest days then it's ok to not take them. But I would give it a shot maybe take like 2 rest days a week for a month and compare your results. Good luck with your journey",1
When working out how do you know when to stop? I worked out once years ago for something once and i blew my arms out. I couldnt straighten them out without horrible pain for like 2 weeks after. How do you go hard enough that you make progress but dont overdo it?,1
Follow a proven program.,1
Follow a program from the wiki,1
You follow a proper program.,1
You just had DOMS. It’s nothing unusual. Also follow a program.,1
Its normal to for your arms to lock up for two weeks,1
Yes. They feel better when you work them out again. Eventually you get minimal soreness after each workout.,1
How many days of weightlifting as a beginner?,1
A lot programs/guides out there indicate 3 days of lifting + 3 days of cardio. Is this really it? Just makes me feel like I'm leaving gains on the table,1
"24 yrs old, fit but noobie to the gym",1
How many days of weightlifting as a beginner?,1
"3 or 4 days is perfectly fine. The most important thing is consistency, time and effort.",1
"If most beginners end up quitting, then their numbers of days ran didn't matter. Choose whichever you think you'll enjoy the most, you'll stick to and that will allow you the most effort. If that's 4 days, pick that. If you think you'll stick to 3, pick that.",1
My gains exploded when I learned to stop worrying about what felt like enough or not and start just putting effort into a structured program,1
Totally understand that but just wondering if properly following a 4-5 day program isn't much more effective than only 3 days,1
"You'll always be wondering if there is a more effective program or methodology. Just start, effort is 80-90% of results",1
"Too many variables to give a straight answer, intensity, volume, duration, current level etc.",1
"Besides that, it's always an ongoing debate, what's ideal for the most gains.",1
"As others already mentioned, it depends on your goals.",1
"Goals can be maximum muscle size (hypertrophy training), maximum strength, overall fitness, a strong bench/squat/deadlift (also known as powerlifting) etc. You should pick a program that suits your individual goals. (Honestly, you can probably pick any program and still do light cardio on a rest day)",1
"A body can only recover some amount of stress. You can think of it as a bucket, if you fill your bucket with cardio, there won't be much space left for training with weights. So if you want the most gains, three days of intense cardio will probably hinder that.",1
"Yes, you will leave tables on the gain. But, are the gains worth it? You need to spend additional time working out which you could use differently. If you want to maximize gains, then work out more. If you want to get the most bang for your buck (time) then 3 times is enough.",1
Number of days doesn't really matter as long as you follow a proper program e.g. from the wiki.,1
Totally understand that but just wondering if properly following a 4-5 day program isn't much more effective than only 3 days,1
just wondering if properly following a 4-5 day program isn't much more effective than only 3 days,1
Not all programs are created equally.  Some well thought out 3 day programs are far superior to poorly planned 5 day programs.,1
All the recommended programs listed in the wiki have proven successful.  Pick one from there and you will be on the right track.,1
"It all depends on what your goals are… whether you’re looking to gain or lose weight, gain mass or tone.. that will determine how much cardio/strength training you do",1
I started lifting in May and have bulked up from 138 lbs to 164 lbs with a 4 lbs mini cut in between. Rn I’m at around 20% body fat and need to go on a 3 week mini cut and was wondering how much fat a week I should try to lose.,1
"Cutting 4lbs is essentially just losing water weight. I’d shoot for losing a pound a week, or a 500cal per day deficit.",1
"If I were only doing a three week cut, I would probably try to cut 2 lbs a week. That is a pretty steep cut, but you are only doing it for 3 weeks.",1
"Personally, I'm not a big fan of mini-cuts nor mini-bulks. It doesn't feel like enough time to make real progress in either direction.",1
Would be visiting hometown for a week or so. I do have weights there but less than I usually lift what rep range should I have to maintain my strength?,1
And also would it be better to switch to a full body program for these lower weights?,1
1 week wont matter. Do some high rep squats until it burns and do pushups until it burns.,1
"Or you could have fun and do linear daily progression. So example: 20 pushups day 1, 25 pushups day 2, etc.",1
Regardless whether you train or not. Your strength won't decrease by much if any.,1
It's a week. Do whatever you want.,1
"All of them. Your brain takes damage and temporarily shuts everything off until it can take stock of what happened. It's kind of like resetting your phone, except once the phone reboots it's now slightly more likely to commit domestic violence.",1
Lmao,1
"I think I hurt my hip Thursday while running at the gym, because yesterday I went to do an arm workout and I couldn't even walk from exercise to exercise due to pain, so I left without finishing. I had walked on the treadmill for 5 minutes before to warm up and thst was also painful.",1
"So last night I did some hip stretches and I wore an icy hot on my hip since the pain got worse through the day from walking around. Today my pain is significantly less but my hip is still tight, so I figure I will still stretch again and maybe do another icy hot.",1
"My question, should I go to the gym today to try and get an upper body workout in, or should I wait until tomorrow? I dont know how much my hip bothering me will impact upper body weightlifting. Or should I wait until after I see my chiropractor Monday?",1
you should not exercise further and you should see your actual doctor asap.,1
"Is it me or the days I eat well I feel that my performance is much better? Thay being said, when I go on Saturday morning I feel weaker than the days I go in the evening",1
"Well yeah, your body is better fueled for the workout.",1
What kind of exercise should I do to reduce my shoulder. I'm a woman,1
"Work on the muscle between your ears. 90% of the time when people (especially women) think something is ""too big/broad/wide,"" it's all in their heads.",1
"It's the most trite, cliche, unhelpful sounding thing on earth, but we really do only get one body, and the best thing is learning how to change what you can, and love (or at least live with) what you can't. You can make muscles bigger, let them get smaller, or keep them the same. You can gain or lose fat. But that's kind of it, barring invasive surgeries.",1
"You can't, its bone structure.",1
"There are no exercises for reducing anything. If you have broad shoulders and it’s not because you’re overweight, it’s your bone structure; and you’re out of luck.",1
The Elliptical for 20 minutes burns around 200 calories. Is that accurate? Does it make q difference if you run sprints or do an Elliptical after a workout for cardio? Or will running always be better or doesn't matter?  Running you feel heartburn more and probably but it also hurts joints. Elliptical you are still gassed and feel it.,1
Elliptical for 20 minutes burns around 200 calories.,1
Where are you getting this number?,1
"The machine says this when I do hill intervals for 20 minutes. And I don't cruise it I work hard during those 20. Try to get the heart rate to 170, can't keep it there forever. So when I start getting tried Itry to keep it between 150 and 160. Then when energy is backup push more and get to 170 for a couple minutes. I also have a smart watch I can compare it with. You dint think this is accurate?",1
I never trust the numbers on cardio machines to be honest. It's kind of outrageous they list what appears to be a random number which rarely has any real world bearing.,1
"As for your cardio, have a read about heart rate zone training. An understanding of that will help you with your goals I think.",1
I mean the number does have a bearing. If you count calories. I count calories dint like to but everyone says to do so. Since you have an idea of how much you are eating. I do it to get an idea. I'm going to compare it to my watch next time.,1
"I know about heart rate zones 150 is aerobic 170 is pushing it higher etc. That's why try to stay in those zones. I can read up more, never hurts to learn more.",1
If your weekly activity is consistent then you only really need to track your calorie intake and the weekly moving average for weight change. That way you avoid the messy (impossible) measurement for calories burned using the more reliable weight scale as a proxy.,1
If the scale isn't trending the way you want it to then adjust your calorie intake. It's difficult to adjust your calories burned (due to metabolic adaptation and being generally unable to estimate calories burned during exercise) compared to adjusting your food intake.,1
Any numbers the elliptical is giving you for calorie burn are going to be very grossly inaccurate.,1
I know that's why I check heart rate zones and also have my smart watch going so can compare both. As I peform the exercises I watch my heart rate on both. Nothing is ever accurate though even heart rate monitors. U less it is the chest strap one.,1
2 workouts with 48h break or 3 workouts with 24h break?,1
"Because of my lifestyle/job/university I have time only at weekends to do my workout - friday, saturday and sunday. What will be healthier option and give better results (weight loss) - workout on friday and sunday with 48h break, or workout on friday, saturday and sunday with 24h break?",1
Workout: about 1h FBW + cardio (for 15-20 min after FBW),1
I mean if you can workout twice a week or 3 times I'd say got for 3 times since you aren't going to be short of rest days the rest of week.,1
Sedentary.,1
Sedentary.,1
Moderate,1
If it's your cheat day why are you worrying about it,1
It's your cheat day. Don't overthink it.,1
"Just curious, how is your cut going have an entire cheat day?",1
"If it's your cheat day, it doesn't matter.  The entire point of a cheat day is to go outside of your normal diet restrictions.  One day of even going way over your goal isn't going to affect you much.",1
We also can't tell since we don't know the size of the meal to estimate calories for you.,1
What's your favorite fitness app for toning up and tracking? I'm happy with my weight. Looked into Centr and liked that there's recipe suggestions... Thoughts or other recommendations?,1
What is toning up,1
"For the triceps, I do DB skull crushers, Triceps rope extensions, and Triceps dips. Is that enough to build muscle? Or are these just toning exercises.",1
"Toning exercises do not exist. ""Toning"" is made in the kitchen. Every of those exercises you mentioned builds muscle.",1
"If that is enough depends on your experience, the volume, the intensity, the frequency etc. Did you make progress on those exercises? Then you are also probably building muscle.",1
What lifts would youse recommend for squat carryover that doesn’t put much strain on your lower back?,1
Bulgarian spilt squats. It allows you to increase the load to your legs without putting load on your back.,1
"Belt squat, if you are lucky to have one.",1
Any (dumbell) split squat variant. Lower weight -> less stress on the lower back and the rest of your body.,1
Front squats,1
How do you measure your body fat percentage and what body fat percentage do you need to have visible abs?,1
How do you measure your body fat percentage,1
"You don't, because all methods are inaccurate.",1
what body fat percentage do you need to have visible abs,1
"It depends on fat distribution, genetics, abs size etc. There isn't a singular bf% for visible abs. If you can't see them your abs are to small or you are to fat.",1
Well yeah I knew the last part lol. Let me rephrase that:,1
Is there a proper way to measure progress towards the goal of having visible abs?,1
"If you've already build some ab size and just want to reveal it, you have to lose fat. So the important measurement is your bodyweight and maybe waist size.",1
Just do a normal cutting phase till you see your abs.,1
"Hi frens, how accurate are skinfold measurements for BF% normally? I got one yesterday at my gym and the outcome was way lower than I expected, it's actually so low that I barely believe it haha. It says 16% but I thought it was around 20-23%. I got the measurement because I am just starting a cutting period after bulking (quite dirty sometimes) for a while and I was kinda curious. Anyway, I definitely got some fat to lose (and I feel very motivated to do so) so I will just ignore the measurement I think.",1
"M, 182cm, 84kg",1
Before I forget: I didn't eat or drink anything yesterday before measuring.,1
"Hiya everyone, quick question here: when doing 531, should I do max tests between every cycle, or should it be like every 3rd cycle?",1
"You don't have to test maxes ever. You should do a TM test, if your TM feels off. But your 1RM and your TM are independent after a few cycles.",1
You can test whenever you want. Your AMRAP sets on the 1+ should allow you to calculate an e1rm though.,1
When using a deadlift bar(preparing for a competition that uses a DL bar) should I only use it for singles? and use a stiff bar for everything else? Or should I be using the DL bar for doubles and triples? What about higher sets like 5 or even 8-12?,1
Just use what is used in competition anything and don't overthink it.,1
"I think doubles and triples make sense. Even 4-6 maybe. It affects setup, slack pull and off the ground the most so I'd make sure ever rep is a deadstop reset, which is kinda annoying for more than 3-4 reps so...",1
Higher than 5 is hypertrophy so using the DL bar is unnecessary. If anything getting the same stimulus and more ROM with less weight is good,1
"That is kind of what I figured, but I really did not now. Thanks. I will use it for doubles and singles and a stiff bar for naything above it.",1
Are you sure there isn’t a very small local gym?,1
Another option is just buying a barbell and plates.  It’s enough to get a great workout in.  You could even keep the PF membership and use it for conditioning and assistance work with the dumbbells and machines.,1
"Have you looked for local gyms? They tend to be better than the chains, anyway. That being said, plenty of people get results working out at Planet Fitness.",1
"In the situation you described, I would stick it out and continue going to Planet Fitness and ask to work in with whomever is using the racks. It sucks, but if there really aren't any gyms in your area and you can't set up a home gym it might be the only option. Based on your description of how busy it is it's likely that the regulars at Planet Fitness are likely doing that already so I'm sure you don't need to feel weird about it.",1
"It's not the same as having a rack and barbell, but at the start of the pandemic when I couldn't go to the gym and didn't have any equipment I found that a pair of gymnastic rings was a lifesaver. They're cheap, don't take up a lot of space, and are really versatile.",1
Switched to a new gym that has almost no machines and no Smith Machine. What would you all recommend for a calf accessory? I tried seated with dumbells and a step but it kills my hip flexors (maybe the step was too tall?). Should I just try to do free weight barbell standing calf raises with a step? They actually have safety squat bars so maybe I can use one of those and hold onto the rack if needed?,1
"You can do them with a barbell and a rack, you don't even need to walk out with it. Just do calf raises there.",1
"Alternatively, you can use the leg press. Just set the safeties to their highest level.",1
SSB works great for standing calf raises.,1
I picked up a ez bar and some plates so I’m able to do some upper body exercise at home. Does anyone know of a program I can follow using this bare bone equipment?

My life revolves around it.",1
"Looking back at my training logs, over the last 4-5 years: I will train religiously for 4-5 months without missing a session. And then something will happen. Maybe I get sick, or injured, or have to travel for work and miss a workout. That leads to two. And before you know it, I've taken a week off. I usually get back into the gym for a while and then something else pops up.",1
"Before you know it, I've missed a day or two and then a week or two. Then a month. And then, it's like the thought of going to the gym and being weaker from a lack of training keeps me from going back to the gym. What the hell?",1
"Has anybody dealt with this before? How to overcome it? It's like I have an all or nothing mentality and it's driving me nuts. Usually a few weeks of missed workouts turns into bad eating habits as well, and before you know it I'm completely off the wagon. Then 5-6 months later something will spark the fire and I'm back at it again. Picking up from where I started to begin with.",1

I've always been able to comfortably do squats by holding a dumbbell in front of me, or recently front barbell squat as well.

Remedies for extreme soreness?

Doing the exercises at a consistent volume according to a program should reduce DOMS in most cases. Is there a reason you suddenly decided to ramp up leg press volume? Whats your program?,1
"Once the DOMS happens, it usually alleviates considerably after the muscle is warmed up with light exercise.",1
Ironically light cardio works great against soreness.,1
"Eat and sleep more. If you are going to up volume, you need to up recovery also.",1
You're right I'm cutting calories pretty deep and started a new job that has me up early. I'm probably doing too much. Or I at least need to make sacrifices in other areas to recover properly.,1

I workout 4x per week (Bball) and only eat 40g protein per day as a 220 lb male 35 y.o.,1
How much would i  have to increase my protein intake to notice a difference? Should i expect a difference in recovery? Strength?,1
"The backstory is, I am vegetarian and really don’t like a lot of the synthetic proteins being put out. I am fine to incorporate a pea protein shake twice a day which would add about 40 g.",1
"Lately, I’ve been finding my body is really running down, and I think lifting will help injury prevention. But I keep seeing studies about the importance of protein intake on recovery. Wondering if it is also help my immune system.",1
"Also note, I’ve been eating this way for 35 years and I’m fairly active so the world is not coming to an end due to my low protein intake, however, I highly suspect is the limiting factor",1
You're reportedly eating 20g less than the physician recommended daily minimum to avoid muscular atrophy.,1
"It's likely that you're miscounting. Regardless, you have a lot of options when it comes to vegetarian protein sources and you should be making an effort to increase your intake regardless of what your other fitness goals are.",1
"As far as I know (wouldn't be surprised if I'm completely wrong), protein intake doesn't directly improve immune health",1
"you can get plenty of protein as a vegetarian without synthetic stuff. even if you aren't cool with eggs, greek yogurt, cheese and tofu can easily add 100+g to your diet. vegans have it harder but even then its very doable",1

"For this routine https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/ , I like keeping a streak at the gym because it builds habit (aka i go 7 days a week). I was wondering if I could do workout A → workout B → workout A → workout B → workout A → cardio → cardio, and how bad would it be without an actual dedicated rest day? would my gains suffer that much? i suppose i could do low intensity cardio but i am just curious if my efforts would suffer",1
"That should be fine. Rest days aren’t a strict requirement and there are plenty of big, strong folks who don’t take any (e.g. GZCL). I would probably cycle A/B/cardio if I was in your shoes, but you’ll be fine with what you’re suggesting as well.",1
"Is it weird that my squat depth is pretty deep? I’ve noticed most people go to about a 90 degree angle and start going back up, while I can get pretty low. Nothing feels uncomfortable for me and I’m not sure if it’s relevant but I’ve always been fairly flexible",1
"no. people are built differently. as long as your brace isn't collapsing or other form breakdowns aren't happening, go as low as you want.",1

"I am trying to get back into lifting seriously, and debating what sort of program to run.",1
I was previously fairly advanced - About 5 or 6 years ago at 185 lbs some of my best sets were,1
"455x9 squats, 500x7 deads, 295x5 bench, 205x3 strict press (I hadn't hit singles in some time, I might have been 540 squat, 585 dead, 340 bench, 225 press for 1 rep maxes)",1
I am now very far from these numbers. I am at about,1
Squat 275x1 Deads 275x1 Bench 290x1 Press 180x1,1
From some maxes I hit this week.,1
"My debate is whether I shoukd run a straight beginner program, or maybe run an intermediate program.",1
"I was thinking of running Stronger By Sciences Reps to Failure template, it will auto regulate every week based off of the rep out.",1
"An LP will give me even progression, but would likely be too slow at first. I also don't really need much practice for the lifts - I had lifted for about 15 years straight up until my 30s. Most LPs are hitting SBD multiple times a week.",1
"But, part of my weakness right now is my mobility - I can barely get into position to squat or pull, and an LP would give me more of that motion lotion.",1
Has anyone been in a similar situation before? What worked best for you?,1
"Can i do same amount of volume with ""supersets"" on compound movements ? I dont mean ""big 4"" but lets say weighted weighted pull-ups and weighted dips, or barbell rows and dumbell chest press. They are all antagonist, but still compound movements, if they are done with like 5-12 reps, each 1-2 reps from failure, do you think that it really wont impact volume on that second exercise (without talking about cardio as limiting factor) ?",1
"Im doing heavy dips and pull-ups for example with 3 sets, 2-3 minutes pause between sets, so i was thinking about supersetting to save time, but idk about performance on that second exercise. Ty for answers",1
"I'm wondering if I can use collagen protein for building muscle mass. I've read and watched some conflicting opinions on this online, however the main point that people who say that it isn't particularly helpful for muscle building raise is that its amino acid profile is much worse compared to whey protein. But if I combined collagen proteins with EAAs, wouldn't that cancel out this downside and make it useful muscle building fuel?",1
"As to the reason why I'm considering this at all, I recently found these pork rinds chips at my supermarket which stunned me with their nutritional profile, a bag of 100g has 70g of protein, 0g carbs and 28g fat. Coupled with a tasty dip, they'd be a ridiculously good and relatively inexpensive source of protein.",1
"generally the deficiencies in certain aminos in certain foods are mitigated by having a diverse diet. if you want to throw in a bag of pork rinds into an already balanced diet, it would be fine.",1
pork rinds sound like a once in a while treat rather than a cornerstone of your diet to me though,1
"Hi all, I've read the FAQs, I understand calories trackers only give an estimate, but what's the most accurate one? I've made a small research and I seem to understand that for the only purpose of tracking calories the Polar H10 (chest strap) is the most accurate. Is that right?",1
"Also, bonus question: is there a way to make it more accurate by pairing it with a smartwatch/band (maybe from the same brand)?",1
Thanks in advance :),1

"I'm interested if anyone has experience with gaining muscle and losing fat as someone who is overweight and hasn't lifted in some time. I'm on a cut of about 0.7% of my body weight per week. I shoot for 1g of protein/lb of body weight per day. I also haven't lifted consistently in about 4 years and it reflects in my lifts, being weaker than when I started high school, I'm 8 years out of high school for context. I'm lifting 3 days/week with a full body plan. I've read the wiki and some of the studies (an example being particpants who were overweight/obese were able to gain muscle mass on a 40% calorie deficit) posted on previous threads, and it seems possible for people with higher body fat percentages (like myself), but I'm still not sure if my goals are unrealistic.",1
I'm not interested in body recomposition in terms of shooting for maintaining body weight while losing body fat/gaining muscle mass as my primary goal is cutting. The reason I'm shooting for both is to raise my BMR and improve my physique.,1
"Has anyone been in similar position and been able to achieve both simultaneously, what was your experience? Any advice or suggestions on things I should change in order to achieve this goal?",1
Short answer: Yes it is possible,1
Long Answer: This question comes up a lot and honestly I think it does more harm than good. The two biggest things I notice in fitness is how easy people think it is to lose weight and how easy it is to build lean muscle mass.,1
You stated your primary goal is cutting I would just focus on that while consuming adequate amounts of protein.,1

Looking to use for pull up assist along with other resistance training when I dont have access to the gym (i.e. John Meadow's programs),1
I have two main questions about weekly volume that I've been struggling with for a while now. I see it very commonly recommended to get roughly 10-20 sets per muscle group per week for ideal hypertrophy. So my questions are:,1
"I'm finding it extremely difficult to hit this volume on a 4 day program (currently SBS hypertrophy, have done 531 before) even at the lower end of 10. Is it reasonable to expect to hit these volume amounts on a program like this without the workouts getting ridiculously long/tiring? If no, would it be recommended to put a few groups at maintenance volume for a cycle while working on other body parts? What if I don't have a specific muscle group that I feel needs extra attention?",1
"How is a program like 531 BBB effective with little accessory volume? You can assume lower back, quads, chest, and anterior delts are covered by the main lifts but this still leaves many groups such as side delts, rear delts, triceps, biceps, forearms, lats/general back, and more for the accessories. But with a recommended rep range of 25-50 for p/p/l per session it seems unreasonable to hit this amount.",1
I understand 531 is commonly used by athletes who need to focus on sport-specific stuff as well. If I'm not doing this (and just lifting/doing cardio) is it still recommended to follow these rep per session guidelines?,1
Maybe these are dumb questions but I'm finding it really difficult to know what/how to prioritize for my accessories in programs like these since it seems unreasonable to be able to do 10-20 sets for every muscle group on a 4 day/week program,1
"BBB is not a program for specificity on aesthetics. Most people don’t need specificity until 3-5 years into their lifting careers and you will make PLENTY of gains running BBB without doing side delt raises and forearm work. Eat, focus on the main lifts, execute the BBB work with intensity, and you will grow all over. Do smart movements for your accessories (dips, chins, rows). Don’t “major in the minors”",1

Lift or jogging first for fat loss? Seen mixed opinions,1
The frame is wrong. Fat loss occurs in the kitchen.,1
"Your weight is your net worth. If you have weight to lose, you're paying off debt.",1
"Cardio is an hourly rate. You can spend your time on the hamster wheel to pay everything down. You have another lever though. Spend less rather than make more. The kitchen is arguably a bigger lever. Rather than spend two hours and associated wear and tear of cardio, can dial back the calories in and have greater gains for your time.",1
"Lifting builds muscle. Building muscle is like investing money. It increases your passive income, more calories burned without any particular work, and has compounding returns. The more you lift the easier it is to stay within target range along with other benefits.",1
"All-of-the-above is the option humans should pursue. Habits are what make effort effortless. 30 minutes of exercise per day is a good system for this to build a habit. Retaining the habit is what's important. Based on longevity research, Peter Attia's recommendation of that as a weekly structure is 3-4x of those sessions as weight training, 3-4x of those sessions as aerobic trainng (low heartrate), and 1x of those sessions as anaerobic (e.g. intervals or other work aimed at VO2-max). Good all round structure.",1
No one gets it perfect. Setbacks are fine. Keep coming back. Each iteration some new piece of the puzzle falls into place. Each time look for a friction point and try to make it effortless. E.g. figure out some meal-prep-sunday to make food easy. Leave gym clothes out with minimal steps.,1
"You only need marginally more activity than your average, arbitrarily lets call it your three-month-average, to signal your body to improve conditioning. In your first year of training any activity the improvements happen faster than at any other time. This provides a very motivational condition when starting out that you can easily signal your body to build muscle or improve neural connections with just a little bit more activity than normal. Call it a two mile walk every day. Make it a habit and year one is the most fun you'll have in your fitness journey. You get ripped guys reminiscing fondly on that first year and get excited to see you set out on getting to do that stage again.",1
"nicely stated, im already low cal and 50/30/20 macros, do both a little hiit and steady state every day, lifting every other day. Checking every box and im seeing results - my question was just a fine tune specific ordering of steady state cardio before/after my lifts. 🫡",1
"neither, eat less.",1
"you generally want to also lift to preserve what muscle you have, and cardio is just good for you",1
"while exercising between 60-75% of your max heart rate, your body will first utilize glycogen in the muscles and liver (created by carbs), and upon depleting this, will fall back onto body fat to process for energy.  for this reason, you should weightlift before cardio, unless you're in a fasted state (early morning workout before breakfast).  you want maximum strength for your resistance training depleting your glycogen stores, and you want the cardio to burn the max amount of fat.  this goes largely out the window if you are on a low carb diet.",1
