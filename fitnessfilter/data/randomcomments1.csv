There have already been 38 mass shootings so far in 2023 alone.,0

I really can‚Äôt stand country music,0
"No offense to anyone who enjoys it, do you, but I just really hate country music.",0
"Every country song I‚Äôve ever heard or anyone tries to show me I just feel like I‚Äôm supposed to be sitting in a Cracker Barrel. And every song is like ‚ÄúI love my girl, my girl loves my big truck and I love my big truck more than my girl‚Äù.",0
Also why is it that every time you‚Äôre driving and have to listen to the radio the country stations are the only ones that aren‚Äôt fuzzy?? I can‚Äôt stand it.,0
"Edit: okay there are way too many comments for me to respond to, I did not think this many people would care enough to weigh in lol",0
To address the main comments I‚Äôve seen:,0
"to respond to my personal favorite I make a little over $60k, I live with my boyfriend of 4 years (I have not lived with roommates in 2 years and I‚Äôm 25) and to the frozen foods part I can‚Äôt even lie I hate cooking and don‚Äôt do it often so we do have a lot of frozen meals ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",0
to respond to all the comments saying to try it or saying I hate it because I want to hate it I‚Äôm really not trying to hate it. I have really tried to listen to it and asked for many recs from many people and I just cannot get into. There are a few like before he cheats and Jolene that I do actually genuinely like and enjoy but it‚Äôs really not many that I like hence why as a genre I just kind of count it out,0
to respond to everyone‚Äôs recs thank you for taking the time to give a suggestion! I will go back through the comments and try to listen to all of them and give it even more of a chance for the people who fall into the above ^,0
"and to reiterate I do not have anything against anyone who enjoys it I really don‚Äôt I just personally do not enjoy the music. I have plenty of friends who love all sorts of country music (popular, newer or older more classic like I see some of you saying) and I never ask anyone to turn it off or not put it on when I‚Äôm with them it‚Äôs just not what I‚Äôm going to choose if it‚Äôs up to me or if someone asks what I want to listen to",0

"I am spot on 6 feet tall (well 6‚Äô & 0.75‚Äù) but people always assume/guess much taller (6‚Äô2‚Äù- 6‚Äô4‚Äù), and women I‚Äôve dated often have challenged that I am only 6 feet when asked. I realized that‚Äôs probably due to guys 5‚Äô9-5‚Äô11‚Äù claiming 6‚Äô, completely skewing people‚Äôs perception of height.",0

I‚Äôm constantly being pressured but I‚Äôm trying my best,0
So im 24 and currently a senior In university (hopefully last semester). Its been six years and I take a long commute to campus as I save money living with my parents.,0
The entire experience with this university has been a complete disaster and ruined several years of my life. The drive/schedule and technology class I have are very draining on me.,0
All I need after this semester is an internship which is not provided by the school. I have been networking and job searching for one over the past three months at this point with no luck.,0
"I am trying my hardest to get through this. I am searching for internships almost every day, attending classes on time and turning in my homework early for online classes‚Ä¶but people in my life weather it be school staff that doesn‚Äôt help or my parents that think I‚Äôm stupid/lazy bring me down.",0

I feel like there are certain demographics that get left out a lot,0
"From my experience it's been stuff like hair, people go eww you don't wash your hair often, but I can't that's not how a lot of black hair works, not everyone has straight hair, some of us wear braids or twists. Do you think we take them out every other day to wash our hair? Someone said I shouldn't get a haircut if I wanted my hair to grow, thing is I don't even get haircuts, I just have 4c hair and it doesn't grow like that.",0
"It might not have been intentional but I saw some posts a while back asking which type of girl/boy do you like. They were all white people, nothing against white people but other types of people exist too damn. It just made me feel kinda down, because I feel like people forget about us.",0

"For those who put other people down for their religion, fuck you, don‚Äôt be a dick who says whatever you believe in is fake and stupid, if it makes people happy and want to have a reason to keep going, then let them be",0
I‚Äôm saying this because I just saw a post with someone who was Atheist talking to someone who was Catholic how all the stuff he believes in is fake. Pisses me off,0

What happened to us?,0
Humanity,0
"Could you imagine if people were as eager to share love and kindness as they are anger and hate? Everyone has snap judgments on people they meet. What if you could silence them? Not the people but the judgments. Truly see people for who they are. Not where they came from, their religion or other beliefs. Just on how they treat their fellow human. I have so much love to give why should I have to hold that in because of social stigmas. Yes there are fucked up people out there that don't deserve that energy from you, but those you trust and hold near to your heart why is there so much hesitation expressing that. Society readily embraces the negative consistently depressing us. Through religion, media, race etc... they keep up against each other. I readily express and share my love. Have a lot of friends that their beliefs vary drastically from mine but that doesn't matter. I love them for there heart, how the treat others. Everyone screws up at some point or another, that doesn't define us. We can always learn and grow, be better. Be that person you want to be, express your love for others, talk and discuss varying options with others. Keep learning till you die, but please for the sake of humanity stop fucking judging and hating. Loving others is the key to truly loving yourself",0

Origination of these short TV seasons,0
"For a long time I was thinking these short 8 - 13 episode seasons of TV shows were a recent development. But I started re-watching Banacek and realized that this actually started at least as far back as the early 70's with  NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie time slot, where 3 or so different TV shows shared the same time slot and rotated airings, allowing each show to cut productions costs by only shooting a small amount of episodes.",0

Too many people nowadays are too full of themselves. They assume that if something falls outside their logic then that must be false or unlikely.

My earliest memory of having OCD,0
"When I was in like 1st grade, I‚Äôd wait for the school bus at the bottom of neighborhood hill with one other girl. That winter I developed the habit of carefully stepping through the same snow footprints every day. It was like a circle of footprints that I‚Äôd walk through while waiting for the bus. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is my earliest memory of an OCD tendency. One day the older girl purposely wrecked my path because I think she was annoyed by me walking in circles. She may have also pushed me down, I can‚Äôt remember. But something between us got so bad, that I ran home crying. There isn‚Äôt really a morale to this story. Was just thinking about that whole interaction and how frustrating OCD can be, especially in childhood when you can‚Äôt properly express or explain such frustrations.",0

It was the end of the 2000's and I was on a date. I was a young teen but ill never forget the way I felt in that moment sitting across from her sharing a plate of cheesey waffle fries; she told me she likes my eyebrows. It's still one of the best few compliments I've received as a man.,0

"It seems kinda obvious that I have started watching TLOU üòÖ. But it did get me thinking about such a scenario for real this time. Doctors or scientists in this sub, what are your theories about it? Unlike those in fiction, do you think mankind really stands a chance against a zombie outbreak?",0
"I hate myself, and I don't know why or how to fix it.",0
Why don‚Äôt most self-described misanthropists hate themselves?,0
"I reckon the majority of people who claim to be truly misanthropic, are not truly misanthropic, similarly to how people claim to be anarchists but still work jobs to make their rent.",0
"Shouldn‚Äôt a misanthropist inherently hate themselves for the very same very they hate humanity? Maybe the definition is looser than I realise? Do most misanthropists hate humanity because they believe we‚Äôre inherently selfish, self-absorbed, desperate, predictable, sinful, evil, etc.?",0
"I feel that, ironically, misanthropic people are often narcissistic",0
The idea of being the person who created or discovered something is overrated.,0
"There was a poll on AI art and people are saying that people shouldn't claim they made the art if it was made by an AI. Who cares? Who cares if you made it or not? If it's your idea, your concept, it's still yours, but also who cares? Getting credit would be nice, but are we really just a species that out there making things we love for credit? Or discovering secrets of the universe for recognition?",0

I love how Ukraine has a logo while all the other European countries have busy and dated looking coats of arms,0
"Ukraine's beautiful and simple Tryzub (""trident"") coat of arms is practically a national logo that wouldn't look out of place among modern corporate logos. It is fascinating that Ukraine's national heraldry is so unique compared to the surrounding nations.

How often do you express your deepest feelings with someone?,0
"I just realized something, people arnt aloud to talk about their fits or rage! Whyd you get to that point, you you went a little crazy. Something got you there right? Thats taboo AF! Whyd you get filled with rage, what happend? Has everyone had a fit of rage moment theyre secret holding onto? And if you've saying NEVER had one. Once! In your whole life.. You're telling me youve never been hurt, conflicted, stolen from, robbed, graped, violated, forced into submission against your will? What else could send someone into a fit of rage, I dont even want to imagine. There seems to maybe be rational, and or irrational fits. Why do we never talk about extreme expressions of emotions. How they change who you are. That seems crazy to me.",0
"Those express that deep deep, secret stuff, How often do you do it and how happy are you?",0

Discrimination of skin colour and religion are considered to be the worst because it is the only type of discrimination to have been used knowingly.,0
"Age discrimination, pretty/ugly discrimination, height discrimination. All forms of discrimination are equally damaging and equally widespread but, because of the very obvious histories behind discrimination based on skin colour and religion and the black-and-white categorization of these communities, those two are considered to have more impact and be more important.",0
"(With black-and-white categorization I mean that religious people and people of whichever skin colour are easier to recognize as communities than ""the community of short people"" or ""the community of ugly people"" because the latter two are relative groups).",0

The internet is bad,0
Maybe mass communication is the next big barrier our species faces as the more we communicate the more obvious the worst and most hideous yet rare and unlikely aspects of our nature people are. This causes less trust between people as it leads to everyone seeking the best for them not the best for everyone leading to the decline of the advancement of the species as a whole.,0

Whenever I see Amazon ads for Vox Machina all I can think of is an ElectroLarynx,0
I have no idea what the series is about and I don‚Äôt really care. I lost interest after the first 5 seconds of the initial teaser trailer.,0
"But Vox Machina is Latin for voice machine, and a friend of mine had laryngeal cancer and now needs an ElectroLarynx in order to speak. And an ElectroLarynx is basically a voice machine. It‚Äôs pretty interesting actually.",0

I think I spend too much time worrying about people who aren't worth my time. I imagine they see themselves in a virtuous way when thinking about our relationship.,0
This person that is my mutual friend is a total dick to me. I've made every attempt to make peace but they are just an asshole to me and it's really comfortable. They likely see themself as the one in the right but I wish they would tell me what made them right and me wrong in their head because God knows I tell them what's bothering me,0

Some gods are just so relatable,0
Let me start this by saying that I find religion fascinating but am by no means an expert on any religion and consider my self to be pretty agnostic.,0
Anyway I just think that there are some gods that I have an easier grasp of understanding and are pretty relatable. Like the Greek gods just love on that mountain over there. Meanwhile the Christian God is the embodiment of good and has existed before everything but also made everything and resides in Heaven which is a place that‚Äôs just perfect in every way imaginable. Then you have Thor who just likes drinking and partying and killing jotuns but can also control storms and whatnot.,0
I just find gods like that much easier to understand why people should worship them cause they‚Äôre pretty relatable.,0

What if cartoon characters regenerated a new clone every decade?,0
"I always find it kind of weird when a cartoon show for over a decade and characters don't age,but time does keep moving in the context of the show. What if Homer Simpson and Peter Griffin and the South Park kids and so on all just were replaced with a clone about every 10 years? Thus,they don't get old and have new experiences. It's why Homer and Marge have about 4 different meeting stories or why South Park can cycle through presidencies and fads.",0

Just realized the fan base of a game I enjoy are all furries.,0
I'm playing a JRPG styled game on Android that I've been enjoying a lot. Found the Reddit sub related to said game and joined.,0
"Day after day it's weird, cutesy, cringy, horny posts. Almost always revolving around sex/relationships of the characters (not game strategies like I was hoping when I joined). I couldn't figure it out. Why are all the posts just so... ugh, like highschool awkwardness. All the characters in the game are sort of half animal/half humans. I think the term is kemonomimi. I didn't think much of it at the time, just interesting game styling and lore.",0
"But suddenly it all clicked. The game appeals to furries, living out their furry fantasies.",0
"I am half weeaboo anyway, so I'm used to weird people into even weirder things, but holy cow, it's whole different level of bizarre. Those people are fruity as fuck. I'm definitely not in my element in that sub.",0
"It's fine, though, as long as they're enjoying themselves. It's not my bag, but I'm a live and let live kind of guy. And most of the posters seem like pretty nice people. It's just weird, like suddenly realizing that your standing in a convention for a very niche hobby with people who are not your tribe. And those people are perverts.",0

People must have dyed their hair yellow or red before they actually evolved blond or red hair,0
"Look at various African ethnic groups, such as the Hamar and Himba, that color their hair with red ocher or henna. You see Kushites in ancient Egyptian art with both red- and yellow-dyed hair, for example. There's also at least one example of an Egyptian princess wearing a yellow wig. I used to think non-European people dyeing their hair those two colors were influenced by Eurocentric beauty standards, but I doubt these ancient Africans even saw Northern Europeans (or Australasians, who also can be blond) on a regular basis, never mind regarding them as superior and more beautiful. If anything, Northern Europe would have been among the cultural backwaters back then, so ancient Egyptians and Kushites would have likely viewed them as unwashed barbarians if they met them at all.",0
Maybe humans were coloring their hair yellow or red before the ones in Northern Europe ever evolved natural blond or red hair? They might even have been dyeing or staining it other colors (e.g. green or blue) that you don't see naturally in humans at all. It could even be that blond and red hair proliferated among Northern Europeans through sexual selection because they were already familiar with it as artificial hair coloring (although the Northern European environment must have played a role as well since the mutations failed to proliferate elsewhere except Australasia).,0

Are figures like the Tooth Fairy and Sant Clause toxic to society?,0
"Years ago, I witnessed a part of my daughter's innocence leave her after I was forced to answer the truth about the tooth fairy. She had been hunting for something in the kitchen and climbed on the counter, opened the cabinet that no one ever goes into, and noticed her baby teeth container in the far back reaches (a special container that the Dentist had given her). When confronted I was taken off guard, I stared silently at her for what felt like a full minute while in my head stuttering and stumbling over what to say and noticed tears forming in her eyes. The 1st thing that came to mind was something like what my grandmother had told me many years ago which is: ‚Äúshe is real and alive in the hearts and minds of children and adults‚Äù. Her immediate reaction was full-on crying. This hurt my heart as I hugged and consoled her which really didn‚Äôt last more than 2 minutes maybe, but it still hurt nonetheless. She began to rationalize things and said maybe the tooth fairy hides them that way for all children‚Ä¶",0
The only real-life takeaway (to me) from that incident is a loss of trust that my daughter had in me to tell her the truth. Because for years before that both my wife and I had played the game to continue leading her into the false narrative.,0

I approach the stair climber now pumped to get my 5 min.

Is it bad to judge people?,0
"Don't we all do it? What does it mean anyway? Usually when we talk about judging someone, it has a negative sense, like you're criticizing something you dislike. So in that case isn't it just as much about yourself as it is about them? You judge according to your own beliefs, standards of right and wrong. It's something you wouldn't want to do so you don't like seeing someone else doing it.",0

"They like to argue that the other person has no reasonable expectation that they will do what they are being asked to do, but that's not really all that true, is it?",0
"For the sake of example; let's say that X and Y are related actions, where Y is normally (but not exclusively) something you can do after X. If you ask me to do X, and I do X, and then I ask you to do Y; you do kind of technically owe me Y.",0
"You asked me to do X, an action that anyone could reasonably believe would lead to Y. That's a basic, implied contract under law.",0
"That said, I can't make you do Y, even if you do technically owe me performance of Y.",0

This trend isn't new, whether it was Led Zeppelin appropriating rock which came from black culture. 80s fashion just being an extension of gay fashion from the 60s.

Hunting is more humane than buying meat (at the store) that came from a factory farm,0
Hunting wild game for food is more humane than buying your meat from the store that came from a factory farm.,0
"For example, Deer hunting keeps their population in check and is healthy for the ecosystem.",0
"Wild game is more healthful, as the animals are natural foresters, move more, and have a natural diet.",0
This leads to a meat product that is more lean and has better composition of healthful fatty acids.,0

My Little Pony Death Scene - Ponies are monsters,0
"I was watching ""My Little Pony: The Movie"" the other day with my kid.  At the end of the movie the bad guy, Storm King, gets turned into stone by one of the ponies as he is falling off a balcony. He hits the ground and breaks into pieces.  His head is clearly intact as they pan away from him.  A few moments later the ponies via magic reverse the stone spell and everything goes back to their prespell form.  Id assume this includes the Storm King, who at present, is in pieces. So he gets reanimated just long enough to realize he has been decapitated and gets to see his mangled dismembered body in a pool of blood before fades into the darkness.  The ponies show no remorse for killing him or ever acknowledge it.",0

As a bonus, he goes around to a bunch of different universities and eats tries the cafeteria food like in Hell's Kitchen. Finally, each episode ends with him giving a quick, affordable recipe that is low effort and will taste good.",0
Sometimes people talk about introversion like it's a problem to be solved.,0
"""You should talk more,"" or ""You should be more outgoing,"" or ""Why are you so quiet?""",0
Why ask me that? Is it because I'm not entertaining enough for you?,0
"I'm good as I am. Besides, isn't it something like 1/3 of us who lean towards introversion most of the time?  You, know, approx 33% of the population? I'm not sure on the numbers for this.",0
"Sometimes I think extroversion gets glorified a bit and is seen as the proper or natural way to be, and it's total nonsense. Real life is not a damn American sitcom, where everybody is social and talkative all the time. It would just being a boring show if they weren't, not entertaining. Then if someone is a bit on the quiet side it's like they must be some sort of weirdo.",0

What was Pickboy from Nickelodeon? Why did he last such a weirdly long time?,0
"The character of Pickboy was originally a parody character that was part of Nickelodeon‚Äôs U-Pick segments, and also regularly made appearances during the commercials the channel had with the hosts, back when Nick had live action hosts announcing the upcoming shows and such for their bumpers that aired from 2002 to 2005. For context, the last time this character appeared on TV, from what I can tell, was 2012, meaning he existed for an entire decade on the small screen, and lasted over three times as long as the thing that created him.",0
"From what I remember, the series of bumpers he originated from, was dropped shortly after a Halloween ‚Äústory arc‚Äù, where the two main hosts spent the entire month of October, slowly transforming into monsters. Once they turned back at the start of November, they stopped acting as hosts, soon after, but Pickboy remained. With the final bumper referencing any of this, from what I can remember, being the witch who initially cursed the hosts, threatening to curse Pickboy next. Obviously, nothing ever came of this, as this ‚Äúbumper continuity‚Äù ended shortly after. But Pickboy remained.",0
"In fact, not only did Pickboy remain, despite the show and host schedule he was a part of being dropped, he remained for a weirdly long time. Appearing at several kids choice awards, years after any kids watching would recognize the character, and he even appeared at a Super Bowl for some reason.",0
"For a character that was just meant to be a silly little superhero parody, who only existed to announce what upcoming shows the audience had picked online, and to add humor to Nickelodeon‚Äôs channel bumpers, he‚Äôs been weirdly much more culturally relevant than one would ever expect.",0
"Like, I get it, the guy who played Pickboy went on to host two Nickelodeon game shows, but like, surely that‚Äôs not reason enough to not retire a bit character from a series of 2002 to 2005 Nickelodeon channel bumpers, right?",0

I think the growing conversation around consent and its value will likely affect the taxation is theft conversation,0
It just seems like consent as a value will spill over into every domain because like obviously an important conversation was had (far more important than public policy regarding taxes) around consent in sexual relationships.,0
"And like that‚Äôs not the only domain across which the importance of clear, competent consent is important. Whatever your feelings on assisted suicide, the difference between that and murder is obviously consent.",0
And so I‚Äôm biased I mean I believe taxation is theft outright and I‚Äôm a voluntarist I believe all relationships between people should be as much as possible based on consent. I just thought I don‚Äôt know how you get around this if you truly value consent.,0
To me a growing sensitivity to consent and making sure it‚Äôs been attained is a positive thing to the world in every domain.,0
I just thought that if the understanding of taxation as theft kicks off it will likely be due to the newfound respect for the value of consent. Whatever you feel I think it‚Äôll be the direction this conversation goes.,0

So the things I'm talking about is like Martin Luther King and the race riots. Indentured slaves.

The Vacuum of Space or Tinnitus?,0
"I believe it's universally known that there is nothing in space, hints why sound doesn't travel and all sorts of other things (very bad) will happen to the human body if exposed. My question for you beautiful minded individuals is this.",0
Why can't we add particles or atoms to space? I mean the space station is still up there. Why can't we add particles to space to allow for a faint wave to travel.,0
Or is it that since the particles in space are under pressure and forced one way or another already and that nothing (sound wave) can get it to move freely to reverberate that sound.,0
"Like our hearing, if the hairs in our ears are being manipulated to lay down or not freely moving then we won't hear the sound wave either. What if that is the case, there is so much pressure in outer space that sound can't travel because there is already pressure on those atoms preventing them from expressing and sharing those waves or electrons. I am probably way off, here it is.",0
I think so many people are depressed and/or suicidal because no one believes in anything.,0
"I'm not saying anything religious, you don't need that. I'm not religious, it's just the hope of there being something looking down on me helps me get over a mistake or a rock bottom scenario. Because the more optimistic and understanding I feel, the quicker I find myself out of such situations. You don't have to believe in anything higher to believe in yourself and just know that everything can and will be okay. You are the higher power.",0
"Every atheist I meet has the most negative pessimistic mindset and outlook on this life they're living. There may have been a few I've met or have known that keep a pretty positive attitude, but in the end, it's always unveiled to be a mask for what they actually felt.",0

"And people consider the way I look at the world means I'm 'agnostic' I'm not. I'm me, but I used to be that pessimistic atheist until something deep inside my existence told me to try another perspective.",0
"I've been depressed and suicidal, and even recently. I still deal with these mental problems, but this feeling somewhere inside just keeps begging to be trusted, and I do trust it. You don't have to believe in a 'God' to believe in this existence that you're currently exploring.",0

Racism and other types of preconcepts will be less and less common,0
"Hear me out, we all know how racism, homophobia and etc. Have been really high since godknowswhat century, and with the success of the internet and social medias, a lot of opinions being said all the time, people will understand completely what is right and what is wrong",0
"When a kid joins Twitter (Poor little kid /j), she's imediatelly nuked with a ton of information and opinions about why racism is bad, this is going to penetrate in her mind like a bullet, kids are easy to manipulate, and even if their parents are racist or homophobic (Which would indeed make her like that, your personality is a mirror of the people you live with), because of the Twitter she still has that little thought in her mind that racism is not a cool thing, and it grows larger if she continues to use Twitter",0
"So, what I'm trying to say is: Even if someone was ""meant"" to be a racist (Because of their parents), social medias would be making them think otherwise and create a conflict of ideologies, in which almost everytime, the ideology of ""Racism not good"" wins.",0
