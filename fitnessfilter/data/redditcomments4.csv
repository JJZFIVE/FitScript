"I'm not new to the gym, but I'm now starting to take it more seriously.  I want to prioritize the muscles that show, while still having a balanced physique. What do you think of this split - chest and shoulders, back, rest, arms(focusing a bit more on forearms), legs(focusing a bit more on calves), rest, rest. If I have time I wil add a fifth arm or chest workout.",1

Doesn't matter,1
Gym reaper belt vs pioneer and inzer. Gym reaper is really popular lately how does it stack up.,1
Pioneer and Inzer have been around for a long time and have made quality products for years. I’d go with them,1
"I was suggested to post this here. Advice on body recomp. 2 part question if you all would be so helpful to give advice. For some background im currently 25, 241lbs, 5'11 got an InBody done says im at about 30% bodyfat. After 5 months solid gym going at the beginning of 2022 I had a minor injury which led to me falling off completely. Im back in the gym now consistent for 2 weeks and plan to continue for, well forever. My main goal is building muscle but of course I want to lose this fat I have asap. Which one would be the most beneficial to prioritize first? Im eating 2600 cals and the scale is going down very slowly. The 2nd question is right now im doing starting strength with stairmaster 30 mins to an hour everyday. 7-10k steps daily as well. I have a few Mind Pump programs and was thinking of running Anabolic. Should I just run starting strength to a plateau or start Anobolic or another suggested MAPS program? Thanks!",1
Lose fat for sure. I started off 20lbs heavier than you and got down to 210 in about a year and was very happy with the strength I built along the way. Recomp will just have you spinning your wheels.,1
As for programs I’m a big 531 fan and 531 for beginners is great to do alongside cardio and is a bit more balanced than SS. I’d run SS to a plateau and then switch to 531.,1
r/Weightroom had a post recently that had some good advice for programming on a cut.,1
Hi all. Soon I will be taking part in a fitness test that I need to pass to join the police. The test is in three weeks. Do you have any advice on increasing endurance and stamina. Thanks in advance.,1
Do the exercises on the test enough to get good at them. Do a few run throughs of the full test so you know what to expect.,1
Practice,1
I have been dealing with hypothyroidism for many months but have not really been exercising due to my symptoms as exercise seems to just make all my symptoms worse and I can’t really recover from exercise anyway with my hypothyroidism. I hope that my symptoms will be resolved in like 4 months because I’m on medication but still not at the right dose. I just wanted to ask those who have ever dealt with a very prolonged injury or illness how to get back into exercising and what to do in the meantime.,1
"Well,  my question is really simple, and I know a lot of people have/had the same doubt here in this sub, but how can I get more muscular and acquire ""more weight"" being a skinny guy at the age of 17? I'm 184cm tall and weight about 60 kilos. But there's a catch , my dad is a biology teacher and is strictly against the use of protein stuff such as queratine. What can I do? I do exercise regularly and eat a lot, I mean, A LOT lol. (English is not my main language, btw)",1
What is queratine?,1
Just eat more food. If your dad is a bio teacher shouldn’t he know that protein is important for building muscle?,1
"Eating a lot and eating energy dense food is not the same. One tablespoon of peanut butter is ""a little"" but it's very dense.",1
Chicken and tuna are the classics like the other guy said.,1
"2g Protein per Kg body-weight. Go for a caloric surplus of 500 kcal. Proteinsources many biology teachers don't have problems with: chicken, quark, skyr, thuna",1
Forgot to start the creatine load phase and I've been consuming 10g daily. I've read 20-25 is the right amount for loading. Is it too late to start now to reap the benefits? I've been at it for a week so far.,1
"You don't need to load it, it does more harm than good.",1
"Just take it daily, like you should anyway",1
"Loading is not important. Just go with 5 g a day. It'll take little longer, but it's not a must to load.",1
You don't need to do a loading phase and most people only take 5g a day.,1
If I’m brand new and trying to get my health better would it be better to do low impact cardio like walking or some HIIT?,1
I'd recommend following an introductory cardio program like c25k.,1
How out of shape are you? What are your goals? Overweight and trying to lose it: start with walking regularly.,1
Couple questions. I can do three pushups if I really really push but that's it. I have to be able to do 27 in a minute (minimum) by November. What do I need to do to be able to get to that goal?,1
I also need to be able to do 10 pull ups but I am unable to do any. What do I need to do to do that?,1
"I have had two different injuries, one right after the other, which has meant I haven't been able to really exercise for pretty much a year and I'm trying to get my fitness up where I need it. I have my first fitness test coming up at the beginning of February and I want as good of a score as I can but I have to meet the minimum standards (see above) by November when it's time for the final fitness test.",1
r/BodyweightFitness has a recommended routine that will get you there.,1
"This is really tough to answer without more information, like height, body weight, body fat percentage, etc. It is the beginning of the year and November is a long time away, however, there are lots of things that could influence the ability to do 27 push-ups in a minute or 10 pull-ups in a row. If someone were to lose weight and increase their pulling strength, they could see a huge progress in their pulling capabilities. As for the push-ups, the same rule applies as the pulling and you would need to progressively overload both of these exercises, meaning you are accumulating more and more reps over time.",1
"As an example this week I accumulated 15 reps, essentially three pull-ups a day for 5 days. Next week I cumulate 18 reps, the week after that 21 reps.",1
"Now this is a very generic example, but is a simple way to increase volume over time.",1
"As for goal setting, you are set. You have a starting point and you have an end point, now. We have to progress volume to build you to your goal over the course of several months.",1
"1-I have a wide biceps ball if I have my arm flexed 90°, but narrow arm if my arm is relaxed (like when walking). This means that I would benefits more from hammer curls than regular curls, because it would emphasize more the brachialis and brachioradialis, right?",1
"2-I don't have dumbells, but I do have an EZ bar. Will grabbing the bar in this sides  /            \  with an overhand grip be same thing as hammer curls? At the end It would have similar hand placement, just rotated a bit more inwards but it still wouldnt be a completely overhand grip",1
"I hate squats. they have honestly kept me out of the gym many times. In terms of leg day exercises I enjoy: leg press, leg curls, leg extensions, deadlifts, calf raises, and rdls.",1
"Lately I've been considering just stopping doing squats and only doing these exercises on leg days. Would this be a mistake? Am I hindering my process badly by taking out squats entirely? Any replacements I should consider? (I also am not a fan of front squat, bulgarian split squat, etc)",1
"I love te hack squat, and the v-squat machine (this one hits my quads really bad)",1
You don´t necessarily need squats for muscle hypertrophy. leg press is equally good for building the quads. The best exercise is the one you enjoy doing. I stopped doing squats because of muscle imbalance due to a knee injury and I´m doing fine with just leg press + leg extension. I do hip thrusts and RDL to compensate the missing body parts though.,1
"I don't like Andrew Tate, and will never support him because of the misogyny and his alleged crimes, but I honestly kind of liked the fitness motivation that he gives.",1
Is there anyone like Andrew Tate out there that isn't a POS?,1
Or any motivation fitness guru that you guys like?,1
"Jujimufu. He’s like Tate but kind, not a sex trafficker, and actually looks like he lifts.",1
So not like Taint at all.,1

"Hello guys, what should i do if i skinny fat? My bmi normal but i have kangaroo poach and little bat wings and i can't find any web or video help what i want. On YouTube it help skinny fat and got muscle but i dont want have those big bicep and big  six pack abs all i want get rid that fat and have normal body look, of course when less fat abs will visible but not as visible as who do workout",1
i have kangaroo poach and little bat wings,1
That sounds cute though :D,1
Eat at a slight surplus and start lifting. Skinny fat means under muscled.,1
"You won't get a big six pack unless you work your ass off for years. Muscle takes time to build. If it was easy, everyone would be jacked",1
Nobody gets huge muscles on accident.,1
"If you wanna lose weight, eat less calories than you burn.",1

Can someone tell me what is ma dong seok training routine if there is any information know.Cause I can't find anything.,1
Check out the sugondese manuals as well,1
"Am I the only one that likes eating a big meal before hitting the gym? I don't even wait for it to digest, I tried taking PWO, having a smaller snack, all of it, in the end the bigger meal always makes me feel ""right"" I guess? For a long time I thought I should eat a smaller snack and shit since that's what the fitness community recommends, but in the end listening to your own body is smarter in some cases I guess.",1
I'm pretty similar. I need to eat before I work out and rarely have any GI trouble from training after eating.,1
"Should i bulk if i am skinny fat. Im 6’0 174 lbs. with slight man boobs and a little bit of a belly, i have been going to the gym regularly and doing 20 minutes of cardio along with eating around 3100 calories a day, how will this effect my body?",1
"Edit: Forgot to mention i do lift as well, i spend 20 minutes on the treadmill and about an hour on weights, ive been focusing on my arms and chest, but i also do abs, shoulders, and back.",1
"Follow a program from the wiki and it should see you making decent gains in muscle. You're going to need to cut at some point, but it's much easier when you have some muscle mass.",1
https://thefitness.wiki/routines/,1
"If you are going to bulk, i.e. be in a calorie surplus, you need to be doing some sort of resistance training. Otherwise it's counterproductive and you'll just get fat.",1
"The question of bulk or cut is how much muscle do you carry to support a cut? If little then doing a bulk first, with resistance training, is probably advised.",1
"I have a nautilus t bar plate loaded and a technogym low row pin loaded at my gym, does it matter which one I use since they are both chest supported rows? I know nautilus is a better brand but it's fucking up my sternum even when bracing.",1
"Use what feels better to you, not because of a brand name.",1
Does it matter?,1
"I mean, the line of pull is different if I'm thinking of the right machines.",1
The technogym low row is a diverging machine that takes you through 45 degrees of elbow abduction at the top of the movement. This means that the tension profile moves from predominantly thoracic lat at the peak eccentric into a more rear delt biased row where they have best leverage at 45 degrees of abduction.,1
A straight bar t-row generally has your arms flared at 80-90 degrees of abduction which will better load the traps and rhomboids. If the handles of the row are themselves at a 45 degree angle to the horizontal you'll generate an internal moment arm biasing the rear delts.,1
Being chest supported is just providing a greater degree of external stabilisation to mechanically advantage certain movements. The orientation of the machine is what will dictate the biased musculature by way of forcing loading onto a particular prime mover.,1
How dangerous is neck training really? And do I absolutely need a neck harness to train it?,1
"As long as you go nuts and load up to much weight neck training is fine, but i can't stress that enough, you dont need a lot of weight to train your neck. We do it at our pro wrestling gym nearly every day as it help protect your head.",1
You don't need a neck harness bit I'd reccomend using one,1
What household items can I use instead of dumbells and barbells?,1
"Water bottles, Ruck sack filled with heavy things, body weight",1
"Im 14 and My parents tell me when i go to the gym to only do stuff like boxing, calisthenics/bodyweight etc and to not lift weights cause it will stop my height and as soon as i cross 6 feet i can start lifting but ive tried calisthenics for about 4 months and even tho i have gotten stronger i havent built much muscle and im sure my macros are alright since im eating decent amount of protein and am on a slight calorie surplus since im skinny. I live in a nice compound (a compound is basically a community of villas) and theres a gym next door and my parents are working so they dont monitor my gym activity and honestly they are pretty chilled out so they wont really bother as long as im doing the essential school work, also because i go to a nice school they think the kids are nicer then they actually are and building a physique will help me alot, SO SHOULD I try calisthenics and mix in STUFF LIKE lat pulldowns and crossovers etc cause they dont involve alot of pressure on the joints like a bar, dumbell etc and will that be 'UNMORAL' So to say",1
Wait training doesn't stunt growth,1

Lifting weights does not stunt growth. Do whatever you want with this information. You can try educating your parents.,1
"Hey I'm trying to go to the gym more but I get deterred from workouts that have a lot of stuff to do. I was wondering if alternating between the workouts below will give me a balanced workout? This is more to get fit than for gains, but I still want something balanced.",1

What does this notation mean?... I'm confused about how many reps I'm supposed to do and in what order...,1

1 set at each of the ascending weights,1
"I’m trying to use the GHD to target the glutes. Is it normal to feel your lower back tire before the glutes? Or am I doing something wrong? I know you engage the glutes by pressing them in the pad, and know not to over extend the spine, but for some reason I don’t feel it in the glutes.",1
"You should feel some stimulus in erector spinae while performing a hip extension. Mainly blood flow, ""a pump"", fatigue maybe. Because those muscles are going to help stabilize, however, the glutes primary function is to extend the hip. Where I would be concerned is if you are feeling cramping in your hamstrings then something may need to be adjusted.",1
"A common misconception is that you should be able to feel your muscles at all times while you are training. Referred to a mind muscle connection. Yes, it can be some stimulus for hypertrophy but it's not necessarily required at all times. In the scenario of the ghd machine, because of the position that you're in, you might be struggling to find the right position (a lack of proprioception). If you were to choose and exercise that you had more contact with a stable surface, It would be much easier to achieve glute hypertrophy.",1
"If the GHD machine is the only thing you're using for glute development, I can assure you that there are better exercise selections that you could utilize that would be easier to progress than the GHD hip extension.",1
"I've looked for stuff like this, but everything on Youtube is different, other sources are magazine and fitness sites that are also full of conflicting info.",1
"When I was a kid we had PE every day, we did really basic stuff as a ""warm up"" before whatever we did that day. Push ups, sit ups, jumping jacks, pull ups. No stretches! It was weird. 30 years later, I've got a 10 year old and his school only has PE two days a week and it seems to go straight to the topic of the day (usually a sport) without stretching or anything.",1
,1
"I know what I can work on myself, but I was hoping to find a good routine for my kid (10) to just help him get down the basics of fitness. Something maybe 20 minutes long, doesn't need a lot of tools (we got a jumprope and some handweights). Not looking to make him be a bodybuilder but be a bit stronger, more endurance, hale overall. Anyone know a good one or source where I can find one?",1
"It's fairly established now that pre-sport stretching is not beneficial and can be harmful, so it's good they don't do that. As for warm-up, the sport of the day is probably not very strenuous. A group of 10-year olds without much experience means it's mostly just people chaotically running after a ball. They'll warm up nicely doing that just.",1
But twice a week is not enough exercise for his health so your on track for adding something at home. The reason you're not finding programs is that the scientific literature agrees it can be pretty much anything. Functional strength training is fine. Running is fine. Climbing trees is fine. Team sports fine. Martial arts fine.,1
"Heavy lifting and max strength stuff should probably be avoided - puberty will mess it up anyway, and there  are some concerns with injury, more with doing too much with inappropriate form that anything fundamental. But with a proper trainer, even this is possible to do safely.",1
"With adults, the most effective exercise is one that they will do. This is doubly so for kids - they don't have the willpower to do something they hate themselves, and forcing/bribing them into it means they grow to associate exercise with being sucky. Some parental guiding is expected, a kid will prefer instant gratification from a playstation or whatever they game on these days, but the key is finding something they enjoy at least somewhat. Kids are different so you'll have to figure out what he enjoys and build the environment for that.",1
"Just find ways to get him running, jumping, throwing balls, climbing etc.",1
Empty barbell deadlift - horizontally movable smith machine or empty barbell on supporter's arms?,1
"Hello. I'm quite new to deadlift and according to my 531 BBB spreadsheet, I have to do 5x10 20kg deadlift for my first cycle of BBB (30% of my TM). I've never practiced deadlift with empty bar before so I was wondering which one might be better - using the smith machine that can freely slide horizontally OR putting the empty barbell on the supporter's arms attached to the power rack?",1
"The problem with the smith machine is that even though it slides horizontally, it would definitely feel different from the barbell. But the pro is that the bar can be placed at the height almost same as the actual conventional deadlift with plates.",1
The problem with the barbell on the supporter's arms is that the lowest possible position it can be attached on the power rack is right below my knee cap. So it feels very awkward for me to lift from there.,1
Freely slide horizontally? Do you mean vertically? How are you supposed to deadlift something that can't be moved up/down?,1
"Regardless, I'd recommend using the supporter arms or just really light bumper plates if they are available. If using supporter arms and they're too far up, you can take a step back away from the supporter arms after lifting it so you can get a full ROM.",1
Supporter arms.,1
It's going to feel awkward to you regardless because you are newer to the lift. That will melt away faster than you think though.,1
"Smith machines are almost never going to be a good substitute for the compound lifts, especially for learning form. The movement/glide of the bar is far too unnatural.",1
"deadlift & squat twice a week, Romanian Deadlift once a week.",1
"in terms of glute development, shape wise, will this do the trick or more is needed? just looking for it not to be flat",1
"I'm wondering If I should ditch the hip thrust all together, since it's over loading my lower back a bit.",1
"That's a lot of volume already, but it's hard to say because you haven't listed sets reps or intensity.",1
"But there are many programmes with only one deadlift day a week which lead to enormous gains, so you're definitely not lacking",1
I think that this is a pretty normal dose.,1
"In one of my pre workouts are 500mg of caffeine, but I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance",1
"Depends, for some people with high caffeine sensitivity it would be a very uncomfortable dose.",1
Nah,1
For the sake of time is it a viable strategy to breakup a workout like:,1
3 sets of flys and decline press in the am then do 2 more sets in the pm for a total of 10 chest exercises that day? Would this be better to do since in theory my form would be better for the 2 more sets due to the “recovery” during the day?,1
"This question isn’t just for chest, but can be asked of any muscle group.",1
Thoughts?,1
If that's the only way you can schedule your training then it's definitely worth doing.,1
Are the dumbell rows in GZCLP supposed to be one hand dumbell rows or two hand? Does it matter? Can I use barbell rows instead?,1
"Up to you, the form in which you do them matters less than just doing them as they are considered tertiary in the program.",1
Is there a link between fat loss and good sleep?,1
"I am a healthy, fit teenager at university looking to reduce my body fat.  I exercise around 10 hours each week and I input less calories than I use at the moment.",1
"On average, I sleep 8 hours per day, but this could be 8 hours from 7am -> 3pm, or 8 hours from 11pm to 7am.  Or it could be 4 hours one day and 12 hours the next.",1
Would reverting to a more normal sleep schedule help me lose a little more body fat Amy quicker?,1
"Consistent sleep schedules (with adequate amounts of sleep) have been shown to promote better body composition (more muscle, less fat) in people losing weight.",1
"If you are at a calorie deficit, having a normal sleep schedule helps in a multitude of ways.",1
"Besides the normal reasons why you want full night sleep (as it ""is"" tied directly to general health not just fat loss), being asleep = not eating. Further, by sleeping, you aren't hungry or feel the need to eat. Sleeping for 8 hours? That's essentially fasting (in fact, if you skip breakfast and wait till noon to eat, you are at a 12 hour fast).",1
"So that's the more layman's way of seeing the correlation. You are literally not eating, your body is having ample time to repair from the effects working out has done to your body, and further, you aren't inadvertently sabotaging yourself by potentially late night eating when you shouldn't cause you are already asleep. So on, so forth.",1
"Don't get too hung up on when you crash for the night, just get your 8 hours in, if you are fortunate enough to be able to.",1
Can boxing wrist wraps work for lifting?,1
The only thing I would change to the typical boxing wrapping is to layer the palm thin and reinforce around the wrist thick enough.,1
"Does this work just as good as them dedicated ""lifting"" wraps?",1
Graphic video of injury with dumbbell press https://youtube.com/shorts/TgeGFYvQyxE?feature=share,1
How does one avoid this? I notice he wasn't on the bench completely before attempting the lift,1
"His set up was super fucked from the jump. Normally, when setting up for a dumbbell press, especially with weights that clearly were too heavy for him, you want to maintain them closer to your center. This goober decide to basically have his arms already extended during the lie back. You can get away with this with lighter to moderate weight, but it's bad practice and form and will lead to you snapping your shit up.  The shoulder ( in this case, it looked like his elbow was actually the failure point)  just isn't meant to bear that much weight in such an awkward angle. If you even were to pantomime the movement he just did without the weights, and just hold them there, you can feel it already in the shoulders having a fuss about it.",1
"TL;DR: If you are going to use heavier weights for your DB Press, maintain the weight closer to your core during the kick back into lying backward. Don't just lay back with your arms already extended.",1

https://thefitness.wiki/routines/,1
At what body fat percentage do you cut? I’m 5’8 170lb around 20-22% body fat (according to my scale). I’ve been lifting for 5 years and have made a tone of progress… only place I’d really like more improvement is my abbs. I count my calories and weight everything usually keep myself at maintenance around 170… (cheat every few weeks) should I just keep cutting till I see progress on abbs? Thanks!!,1
"If your primary fitness goal is to have abs, then yes, cutting would be more conducive to that goal.",1
"There is no minimum/maximum bodyfat percentage to cut at. While I wouldn't recommend a person with 50% bodyfat go on a dreamer bulk, or a 5% individual cut, individual athletes have their own goals, and my general advice is to do what you're most excited about.",1

Hello!,1
"So Ive been working out for a month now, last sunday during my back sets i think i screwed something up with my form because ive been feeling tightness on the left of my right shoulder blade (scapula) that comes and goes ever since.",1
"My question is, does this warrant me to take a break from lifting, see a pt, etc or should i just rest for a week maybe and get back into it?",1
"Don't take a break, that just leads to weakness and deconditioning, increasing your risk of future injury. Do what you can, keep it mobile, see how much exercise it will tolerate and try to push it a little week by week. It's unlikely you've done any major damage since it's just a feeling of tightness.",1
Was it immediate. Or maybe it’s just doms.,1
"I can't say what is right for you, but I can say that if I took a break every time something was tight or achy I would never have gotten anywhere with my training.",1
"Second, the idea that if your form is perfect you will not have any aches or pain is incorrect.  Injuries and tweaks happen for all sorts of reasons, and if you train with anything above a mild intensity you will experience them regardless of your form.",1

I'm 6'4 220 pounds and when I cut I eat 2800~ calories. 1700-1900 is an extreme deficit.,1
"If you are in a caloric deficit, yes. You will lose weight.",1
Your calorie goal seems low to me.,1
Very likely.,1
"Is there a minimum of time to spend on a workout? I’m a beginner, and I noticed in my legs day I spend 1 hour or so, but in my upper body I usually just spend 40-45 minutes. Am I doing something wrong? Do I need more series/exercises? Thanks!!",1
My record for a full 5/3/1 workout (not counting stretching/mobility work) is I think 27 minutes. You're good.,1
It's up to you how long you spend. 10 minutes a day is infinitely better than 0 minutes. The added benefits  diminish as you move further though.,1
Most people find 40 to 60 minutes to be a sweet spot in terms of balancing gym with other parts life.,1
What does your routine look like and what are your goals?,1
"There isn’t a minimum time spend on weight lifting. For cardio you want to try and get in at least 20 minutes a day 3-5x per week to improve your endurance, but that doesn’t translate well to lifting weights. With lifting weights it’s more about volume and intensity of the lift forcing adaptive change in your muscles. By and large it doesn’t matter whether it takes you 15 minutes or 25 minutes to bench press, your improvement is far more dependent from the load you push and how many times you push it.",1
10 minutes.,1
I wake up very regular to pee at night. At best it's 2-3 times but at the moment jts very bad at around 6-8 times at night. I'm a 29 year old male and work out 5 days a week and run for 2 days. I'd say I still get around 7-9 hours of sleep every night despite waking up so often.,1
"I'm curious to what extend this is affecting my growth/progress in the gym? There are days that I'm more tired that others but in general I got used to it. It still sucks but life goes on. I work out every morning around 7:30 am, before work.",1
Try a pelvic floor specialist Physio. They can give you some exercises to help manage. Especially if there is incontinence or close calls.,1
Speak with a doctor.   You should be sleeping through the night uninterrupted by the need to use the bathroom at your age.,1
"I currently weigh about 240 and I want to lose about 50lbs. I’ve begun to run, bike, and lift. According to my TDEE I’m at about 3,600 calories, and my watch says im usually between 3400 and 3800 per day right now so I’d guess that’s pretty accurate. I’m tracking my food and I’ve been eating approx 2400ish. I feel satiated and in trying to eat about 160g of protein per day.",1
Is this too drastic a deficit if I’m working out? I just worry about injury if I try and lose weight too quickly while also attempting to get back into shape. I figure losing more than 2lb/week for the first few months is probably not too drastic but it is outside of the suggested deficit,1
I would follow this approach for 20 pounds and then take a diet break. Losing 20+ lbs has always been where real diet fatigue sets in for me.,1
"My preworkout isnt working. I bought C4 and tried for a week, felt nothing then took two scoops for a week and still felt nothing. I have never even drank coffee so its not a resistance to it and i take it fasted. Why is this happenening?",1
Don't take it then it's not mandatory,1
My preworkout isnt working,1
Why are you taking PWO? What experience were you expecting? It's just jitter juice.,1
Have you tried not taking pre workout and seeing how it compares?,1
"I think you’d see more progress doing full body workouts, yes.",1
Suboptimal? Sure. But what difference does it make?,1
"The best, most optimal program in the world doesn't amount to a hill of beans if you're inconsistent.",1
"What you're doing is working for now, so keep doing it until it doesn't.",1
"How do you stop your wrists from bending back on bench? I've seen some people say squeeze the bar to keep the wrists straight, any other tips or advice? Also, my gym has this type of bench, how can I get a good bar path without hitting the hooks? I feel like I'm too straight up and down and when I try to press back and up I hit the hook. I'll post a form check when I bench next so sorry for no video.",1
"Squeezing the bar won't help with this issue. You have to place it on top of your tibia bone, it takes some getting used to. Imagine you had to push the wall with your hand or hit someone with the open palm, what part of the palm would you drive force into ? Same thing for bench. Your wrists shouldn't  feel much pressure.",1
The bench you posted is good. Move your body forward if you are hitting the hooks.,1
"As a beginner, I would suggest a thumbless grip. It's how I taught my wife to bench and it helps develop a feel for where the bar should be in the hand.",1
"Now if you find yourself clipping the job hooks, this isn't great advice.",1
"You probably need to set up a little further to the front of the bench and maybe ask for a hand off. You might have trouble unracking, so play around with that.",1
https://youtu.be/td9TgvbWAhU,1
i hate cooking what if i only eat protein shakes,1
That sounds unhealthy.,1
Why not meal prep? I make beef stew in my instant pot with 15~ minutes of prep and it's lunch for 5 days.,1
"Cheddar, tofu, Greek yogurt and nuts all contain plenty of protein.",1
"Then there's canned meats, protein bars and oats.",1
"Most of the common meat cuts can be baked in the oven, which involves minimal effort.",1
Every once in a while you can find decent frozen meals.,1
"Baking is where it’s at bro. Throw that shit in the oven, set a timer and then take it out. Doesn’t get much easier than that.",1
r/soylent,1
"If you want to shit some absolute bricks, go for it",1
Is it fine to do a DB chest fly with just one dumbbell? I want to do some added exercise at home when I can't get to the gym but only have the one dumbbell for now,1
Yeah why not,1
Anything is better than nothing. I would put my unused hand on my pec,1
Not good,1
https://thefitness.wiki/faq/is-this-lifting-routine-any-good/,1
Don’t make up your own. Follow an existing template and add in your sprinting / boxing as cardio.,1
There isn't enough information here to form an opinion,1
Can someone let me know if my split is okay? I am finally getting back into lifting after MANY years off :-/,1
I think I got a system I like,1
"Monday Back, Cardio",1
"Tuesday Shoulders, Abs",1
Wednesday Arms,1
Thursday Legs,1
"Friday Chest, Cardio",1
https://thefitness.wiki/faq/is-this-lifting-routine-any-good/,1
Follow a vetted program.,1
"4 days upper, 1 day lower? That isn't great to begin with. If this is the first step of your program, I would recommend picking one from the wiki.",1
"What days you train certain body parts is very low on the priority of training programming. It would be to your benefit to run an established beginner program which will lay out a split along with progression scheme, intensities and movements.",1
What are you looking for from a program?,1
"You are a beginner, choose a program from the wiki and run it.  That’s all you need.",1
Hey guys!,1
"Context: Back then in 2015 until 2017 I used to lift and train 4-5 days a week and I was focused on heavy lifting. I could reach big numbers (for me) like 100kg (220 pounds) bench press, 180kg (396 pounds) deadlift and squat 1.7 times my weight. I was following MuscleForLife guide (which was preeeetty similar to GZCLP).",1
"Now that you guys know me, I haven't lifted since like... 2018? And I was looking for a good beginner workout (I'm not a beginner but my body feels like one lol) and found here GZCLP.",1
I have some questions:,1
"Is it enough training? Today I tried for the first time the Day 1 that's in the wiki (Squat, Press, Lat Pull down) and took me 27 minutes + 10 warm up.",1
"No biceps or triceps training? I know that compound exercises are good for the biceps and triceps, but is this ok?",1
Should I be doing this program?,1
Just add some as a T3 if you want. It won’t hurt anything.,1
Gzclp can be expanded.,1
https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/44hnbc/strength_training_using_the_gzcl_method_from/,1
"You'll start with 3 movements. Then 4. Then as many as 6 (T1, 2x T2, & 3x T3)",1
"Hi. I've been training for 4 and a half months running metallicadpas ppl mostly. Also tried PHAT and Gzcl but didnt like them. I'm male, 27 yo, 189 pounds. Will try to explain myself as good as i can since english isn't my main language. Lately PPL is taking a toll on my body since i run it as a 5 day split, (PPLPP RR LPPLP and so on). Most weeks include a deadlift day followed by a leg day and my lower back isn't recovering well. Don't wan't to risk it and get injured. Doesn't feel right.",1
So ive been thinking about using the next lifting schedule:,1
Mon - Legs (Starting with squats 3x5),1
Tue - Chest (starting with bench press 3x5),1
Wed - Back (starting with DL 1x5+),1
"Thu - Shoulders, biceps and triceps (starting with OHP 3x5)",1
"Fri - Legs again. (starting with squats 3x5. Legs are half my body, training them twice a week makes sense to me)",1
I want to slowly progress on my main lifts strenght wise but my main goal right now is aesthetics. After my main lift of the day i plan to focus on accesories according to the day's muscle target.,1
Currently on a recomposition diet eating around 2800 calories.,1
Would that work? What to lookout for to prevent imbalances or possible injuries?,1
Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks in advance!,1
https://thefitness.wiki/faq/is-this-lifting-routine-any-good/,1
Looking for ideas/recommendations!,1
"I’ve seen a few tiktoks of various “fitness challenges” that seemed fun and would be a cool series of things to do/film. The two I’ve seen are this woman doing 100k steps in 24 hours (walking, running, etc) and another where a group of people kayaked 31 miles around the island of Manhattan. I’m athletic and these are definitely things I could do in a day and they seem fun and challenging so I’m looking for more ideas!",1
"Can you guys think of anything that would be challenging, can be done in a day or 2, wouldn’t require going somewhere specific (as in, could access whatever I needed within a 1 hour drive, i live near NYC), and could be created into a fun video that people would want to watch?",1
trying to think of nyc things,1
walk up and down those joker stairs in the Bronx as many times as you can rocky style,1
do the NYC marathon route in all 5 boroughs,1
biking all 5 boroughs would be cool and easier than running,1
bike every big bridge in a day?,1
"Body weight stuff: squats, push-ups, stairs, handstands, etc",1
I’ve been sick for almost two weeks now and I look smaller. Is it in my head or is the cold taking away my gains. Also how long will it take to get the gains back,1
Gains take more than two weeks to visibly be gone. Try two months. It's just water weight or glycogen in your case. Will be back after a week of training again.,1
"Colds make you dehydrated, dehydration makes you look smaller. Don't worry about it, you'll be back to normal soon.",1
Are push ups enough to build defined chest? And will they also make my shoulders bigger?,1
They're a good starting point. Getting some resistance bands and doing different push up variations can get you quite far. Push ups are very underrated,1
"There's gonna be diminishing returns on muscular development even if you really push the reps. Overloading with harder variations after a certain point, as mentioned, will help. Getting access to a weightroom is what will really push your physique forward.",1
you'd be better off doing the r/bodyweightfitness push progression.  they have a whole routine that's pretty good,1
"I’m going to start body recomping, but don’t know where to begin as I don’t know what my “maintenance” weight is. I’ve recently gained a bit of weight (about 15 pounds) which I’m happy about. However, in my mind at least all the variables are still fluctuating. Any advice?",1
"If you're willing to pay for a tracking app, MacroFactor is great for calculating your TDEE based on the data you input.",1
Just start tracking what you eat every day and take an average. After 1-2 week see what happened to your weight and adjust.,1
Normal for my working set to plummet after a 2 week break?,1
—-,1
"Mid December I benched 2 plates for a PR (225 lbs), and my working set was ~195 lbs.",1
Then I got sick with a cold around Xmas / NYE. I also had family emergency the first week of January and was pretty stressed out (little sleep).,1
When I finally came back I was struggling with even 165 lbs. Wondering what happened? Body still recovering? Stress making it worse?,1
"Yes, very.",1
"Here's a comparison: at the end of last year I squatted 275 for 10 reps. I couldn't have done that for more than one set, and it was a very hard set all in all, but I did it.",1
"Yesterday I went back to the gym after a 3-week illness-related hiatus and tried to do 230 for a set of ten. I was so gassed at the end that I lowered the weight to 205 for my second set, and barely got that done.",1
"I wouldn't be that upset about it if I were you. You can more or less bounce back from this in about 3-4 weeks of consistent training, and plus it's unlikely that your strength loss was caused by muscle loss. You just need to reacclimate to the weights.",1
I can hip thrust 705 for 2 reps. This is my second time doing hip thrusts and I am 5’ 7” and 175lbs. Does this mean I have genetically strong legs or is 705 expected at my height and weight?,1
Would def post a form check on those,1
Good chance youre not doing good reps,1
Your other thread said your squat was super low. Sounds like you have a huge muscle imbalance or low mobility.,1
"Are pull ups/lat pulldowns necessary for beginners to maintain optimal shoulder health and posture? I know they are necessary to achieve an aesthetic upper back and lats, but I noticed many beginner routines (SS, SL, ICF) don’t even include a vertical pull (and instead opt for pendlay rows or power cleans).",1
Pull-ups are great from a shoulder health perspective as they take the shoulder through upwards rotation. There are plenty of good beginner routines that include a vertical pull like a pull-up in their program.,1
"You noticed that particularly poor beginner routines neglect pulldowns/pull ups. Better routines include them, like the Beginner Routine in the Wiki or GZCLP.",1
My deadlift form goes to shit on my descent. My back really rounds as I put the bar down. I also have a very round upper back just naturally. Any tips?,1
Drop the bar while maintaining contact with your hands like in a powerlifting comp,1
Make sure to unlock the hips first and then the knees?  This is what helped me.  Also helped me to practice this with the 10 lb plates.,1
How are you measuring this? Got a video?,1
"Don’t worry about it?  As long as the back isn’t curving more while under load, it’s fine.",1
Was just lifting in the gym doing shoulder presses and suddenly the tip of my nose started pins and needles tingling. Is that normal or should I be concerned.,1
"It's a bit weird. As a one off? Eh, I'd ignore it. If it repeats, I'd look into causes.",1
What were your numbers when you began to look like you lift?,1
This varies highly by the athlete and their genetics. I always got compliments on my arms even when I casually did dumbbell curls in high school. People assumed I was a massive lifter but I just had good biceps genetics.,1
"On the other hand I bench 270 pounds now and while my chest is 47 inches, I'm barely beginning to develop the so-called ""pecs."" I can deadlift 480 but only recently started to get half-decent glutes.",1
"Please someone help. Every time I try to cut within 1 week I experience extreme fatigue and tiredness, my libido tanks and I feel absolutely terrible. I go from someone who is disciplined and does cardio, lifts, stretches etc to someone who literally can’t do anything. Lifting is nearly impossible. I eat enough protein, eat above 100g+ fats and eat 2000-2500 calories, depending on the activity of the day. My height is 5’11 and I weigh 76kg / 167lbs. My diet is solid yet cutting is impossible no matter what, there is absolutely no way I could continue to cut like this as I have done in the past and it was so bad that I became depressed. Has anyone else experienced this? Please can someone help, I can withstand the hunger cravings fine but not these other symptoms",1
How big is your deficit?,1
"I would switch to lower fat, higher carb.",1
"If you're eating 2000 cals, assuming 'enough protein' is 1g/lb your macros look like this:",1
167g protein = 668 cals; 100g fat = 900 cals; 108g carbs = 432 cals,1
"I have super low energy, always  and lots of cravings too when I tried to do a higher fat diet. My body just works better on carbs.",1
I would try something similar to: 167g protein = 668 cals; 40-70g fat (0.5-0.7g per kilo) = 360-630 cals; 250 carbs = 1000 cals; Total: 2000-2500ish,1
"Give it a few weeks and see if your body prefers it. Remember you will be hungry and uncomfortable on a cut, that's inevitable. But it doesn't have to be that extreme.",1
Edit: formatting is weird but this is the best I can do.,1
"At 167lbs at 5'11, I do not imagine there is much to cut down too.",1
"In this situation, I would add some muscle to my frame FIRST so that I could cut down to something.",1
The best thing to do might be to talk to a medical professional; to me this seems like an extreme response to calorie restriction.,1
"Have you tried reducing your calorie intake very slowly, instead of going straight for a low calorie target?",1
If I can't seem to keep both elbows tucked for squats what would you think is the problem? No matter how hard I try my left shoots up and it makes my rack position uneven.,1
"a wider grip on the bar could help?  I go as narrow as I can while still being able to ""lock in"", that width actually gets narrower through my squat sets as I get warmed up",1
"It may be a mobility issue, which you can work to correct.",1
I'm sorry but I'm imagining the scene in Talladega Nights when Ricky doesn't know what to do with his hands and they just keep floating up....and I got a little chuckle out of it.,1
"Does anyone have any advice on dealing with sleep disruptions in calorie deficits? I'm getting insomnia or intense half-awakw/half-asleep ""dreams"". When I get up because of them and eat I'm almost immediately tired.",1
"Im only in 250 kcal deficit at 24.4% BF. Been strength training fairly hard, no cardio to speak of atm",1
"I don't think such a small deficit, should be giving you such problems.",1
"But try bringing up the 250 calories for a week or two, without changing anything else, including when you normally eat, and see if that changes it.",1
Do you take caffiene I fine myself very vulnerable to caffiene on a deficit,1
My period delays for many days when I workout (weights). Does this mean I should go slower or can I just workout like always?,1
If you don't get a good answer consider asking r/xxfitness,1
What do you mean delays? Like it comes later now that you're working out? Or it delays your workouts because you don't feel able to work out?,1
"If its the latter, unless i'm having a super mega bad day (like cramps that painkillers aren't touching and a super heavy flow.. very rare for me) I'll go to the gym and get a workout in. Often, activity actually helps period pains. You may feel like shit to start, but just do what you can. If that means you have a lighter day because your strength just isn't there, then so be it.",1
Should you have no fat on your arms? I've seen a couple of videos of people(obviously not natty) flexing biceps and they only pull up skin. Flexing my bicep I have maybe an inch of fat pulling up and a lot of fat hanging from the tricep(like those fat old lady arms). Flex tricep and its the opposite side with fat hanging on the bicep. Will I be vascular once I lose enough weight to pull mostly just skin from my arms? I miss my bicep vein bros.,1
"If you're trying to gain mass/muscle, it's normal to gain fat with it. This is a professional bodybuilder in the off-season. You're trying very hard to convince your body it needs to add mass to adapt. You need calories, you need energy, you need materials to rebuild. You don't want to go overboard and gain waaaay more fat than muscle, (people's dirty bulks/if it fits your macros type diets don't always work out) but you don't want to fear carrying some fat.",1
"When people are really lean to the point where they have paper thin skin, they look impressive but it's not always the best for performance. They're usually very dehydrated and not at their strongest. You can certainly have periods where you look like that yourself but if you want long-term progress and want to keep abs the whole time, you're gonna hamper yourself.",1
What kind of insight are you looking for here?,1
"You're looking at people that went for a specific look and asking if that's some kind of generic ""should"".",1
Then you are asking if you will get the same effect by pursuing that effect and goal.,1
I'm not sure what you need us to answer for you.,1
Fat distribution is genetics. When I gain weight all I get is fat stomach area and on my arms it's just skin as you're saying.,1
Hi I have a very silly question (or maybe I just need some encouragement that I’m on the right track).,1
I was very into fitness and happy with my body. A couple of things happened and it’s been about 3 years and 40 ibs of weight gain. I’m back into a consistent schedule and my eating is on track. I’ve struggled with some ED and whenever I count calories I wind up severely undereating and it makes working out and eating really sucky when it’s something I have enjoyed before.,1
"So, right now, I’m not tracking but eating consistently, home cooked and healthy. Sticking to what worked for me in the past and im happy with my diet. For working out, im doing a four day split, lower body, upper body and core, cardio and core, and full body. I have a spin bike, and I hop on that for about ten mins in the morning and 10 mins in the evening. Rest days are yoga and walk days. Because im just getting back into it, my body is pretty sore, so if im feeling extra tight and sore, I swap the bike for a walk and a good stretch.",1
"I have a tattoo appt to get started on a sleeve and im not stoked with how my arms are looking. I know it’s silly, and im obv not gonna drop 40 ibs in the month before the appt. However, I guess im just second guessing myself. I want to look and feel good and im wondering if I should be doing more cardio? I want to stay toned and be strong but the spin bike should help with that. Im also wondering if anyone has experience with how tattoos look after healthy and consistent weight loss? I’m almost considering pushing the appt if I’m just gonna wind up making the sleeve look silly after I lose weight.",1
Sorry for the book and thanks in advance everyone :),1
"So from reading this I'd say your goals are weight loss first and muscle gain second?  If counting calories is a no from you, is tracking your weight on a scale and taking the average on the table?  Just to see if you're going in the right direction to align with your goals.  I'd say if you do this and see you're not losing weight maybe consider eating more veggies when you're hungry as their very light on calories and heavy on satiation.",1
"I'd be nervous too about wanting to lose 40 lbs and getting a big tattoo!  maybe hold off until your happy with your body?  40 lbs is a lot to lose and your body will look different so your tattoo will look different.  It depends on your viewpoint I guess, I have a tattoo with inch markings around my arm and I want to stretch it out because I think it would be funny to make it inaccurate because I got big.",1
You didn't really ask but maybe take a look at some of the r/fitness recommended routines in the wiki to see what is currently popular with the strong internet people who hang out here.,1
https://thefitness.wiki/routines/strength-training-muscle-building/,1
"is it ok to change the order of my workout program? Most of the time, the barbell spots are being used",1
If you're okay with the decreased performance from doing thing later then it's okay.,1
I used to be strict in keeping the order.,1
"But now I'd rather shift the order around (within reason) in order to save time. With the time you save you can either go home, or squeeze in a few more sets.",1
"you dont need the band to support your entire weight, just some of it",1
Rogue and EliteFTS both sell bands for up to 200lbs resistance,1
"The band isn't going to be supporting the entirety of your weight when you're using it, you should be fine.",1
You can double up on bands,1
"I just started going to the gym again last month because I got the kick again. Like many new gym-goers, I’m extremely unfit and weak. Most of my muscles, especially the minor ones that are involved in the smaller movements for lifts are virtually unused. I’m 181lbs and 5’6” 19M.",1
"I have ADHD and struggle a lot with motivation and overcoming obstacles. Recently, I’ve been having a lot of trouble working on my form. I have no idea how a straight back looks or feels and I also have no idea how to properly breathe during a lift, engage my core, or any other essential parts of the lift that don’t actually involve lifting.",1
"This has been extremely defeating recently because I feel like I’m going to create bad habits, potentially injure myself, or just not make any progress. I know that practice will eventually make me get better and all of the guides on the wiki are extremely useful!",1
"However, my primary question is whether it’s better to just do my workouts and lifts with poor form and pick up better form as I go and potentially pick up nasty bad habits and crutches, or perfect my form now while I’m in low weight ranges so that the rest of my fitness journey is smoother. The main risk I have is that if I spend too much time focusing on the actual form and don’t make much progress on actually lifting, I feel like I will lose the motivation to go the gym entirely. Whereas if I just go and lift with poor form, I feel like I will pick up nasty habits that I rely on when I’m in heavier weight ranges and it’ll be harder to perfect my form later.",1
"What do you guys think? Any advice to navigate this issue, or any advice for making going to the gym a habit period with ADHD?",1
Thank you!,1
"There's a lot of ""I feel"" statements in there.  Do you just feel this way or do you have an actual, objective problem?",1
Your form is good enough for now.  You will probably never stop trying to refine it.  Trying to perfect it (which is a lie) at lower weights will not help you when you're working with challenging weights and will only serve to hold you back from making real progress.,1
"Hi, I'm getting back into lifting after an extended pause due to illness. I've noticed that during heavy sets bench pressings (3x5) I feel slight discomfort/pain in my right front shoulder. It's not too bad but bad enough that I don't want to continue with the exercise for fear of injuring my shoulder. This also happens with dumbbell presses. On all other pressing movements everything is fine, I'm doing cable flys, incline bench press, incline dumbbell press, overhead press and lateral raises, no issues whatsoever even for heavy sets.",1
"Now, should I just stop benching altogether and only do incline movements? Or are there other shoulder exercises I could do to possibly fix this issue? I currently mainly do face pulls for shoulder health.",1
I would suggest posting a form check and then going from there.,1
Oddly specific question incoming:,1
"Before I had put on weight, I had some very active crepitus in my shoulders and they would pop a lot. This was about 50 lbs ago, a few years back. After I had put on the 50lbs (primarily fat), that all went away, and I actually had what felt like stable mobile shoulders.",1
"Now that I am losing weight again (down 10 lbs since a month ago) the creaky groany shoulders returned. Is it possible the fat ""insulated"" the shoulders in a way to prevent them from doing that? I never heard of this happening to anyone before, and I just thought it was bizarre.",1
Anyone else finding themselves losing count as they workout? I find myself having brainfart moments where I lose count in the middle of my set.,1
"lmao yes all the time, for some reason I always skip a number between 10-13 on higher rep sets, Ill be like 10.. 11.. 13..",1
Ill also forget how many sets Ive done if I dont write it down,1
Currently am in a calorie surplus. I’m trying to gain muscle and about 10lbs. I’m underweight and come from a past history of undereating and find that I’ve been super bloated (not painfully though). Is it normal to be bloated when bulking? Does it go away overtime and is there anything I’m doing wrong that I should change?,1
Yes it is normal.,1
"We could be of more assistance if you describe what a day of eating looks like, what foods you're eating, how much, and when.",1
"In addition, going from a caloric deficit straight to a big surplus can be a lot. Easing into it doesn't hurt.",1
"It takes a little time to adjust to the feeling, but yes - in general you will look and feel fuller all the time, mainly due to water and glycogen stores being full up.",1
"You might be overshooting it, but you won't know that until you start to see the results.",1
Is it bro science that you deplete your glycogen stores during weight training so if you do cardio at the end it'll pull from fat stores for energy?,1
Even if it is true so what ?,1
"You can’t make energy out of nowhere the only thing to that matters is CICO. If you burned more calories than you ate over a month you will lose fat over this month. Regardless of glycogen levels, metabolism speed etc.",1
Yeah kind of gathered this is the case. Thanks,1
"Yes. Cardio after weight training is still a good idea for multiple reasons, but this is not one of them.",1
What do y'all think of my routine ? I do it 2x per week or 3x if time permits. Takes me 70 minutes if I don't wait for equipment. 2 warm up sets for the main lifts and 1 warm up for accessories.,1
Main:,1
Bench 3x5,1
Squat 2x3,1
Deadlift 2x5,1
Accessories:,1
Pulldown machine (any) 3x5,1
Abs 4x max reps (typically 15-20),1
Leg curl 3x15,1
Tricep rope extensions 3x15,1
Front raises 1x15,1
Lateral Raises 3x15,1
Curls 3x10,1

Thanks. Idk how I missed that.,1
"Or maybe I saw it but thought it applied to the ""brand name"" routines haha.",1
Thanks,1
"It looks similar to other beginner programs that focus on full body and compound exercises - but why only 2x3 squats? 6 reps is not a whole lot of opportunities for your muscles to practice the movement. Same for 2x5 deadlifts, its very low volume.",1
Is squatting easier in Chuck Taylors or Vans?,1
"I ask because I just got myself a new pair of Chucks and realize the toe box is very narrow, which is not conducive to stability. Now I'm wondering if I should switch to Vans, and if so, which Vans are the best for squats?",1
Extra details:,1
I've been squatting in Chucks for the past 5 years,1
I realize squatting barefoot is better but I don't want to walk barefoot at the gym. Socks also do not work as it causes slippage.,1
"I believe Vans have a wider toe box than Converse, but have not confirmed this for myself",1
"Honestly, the best shoes to squat in are squat/weightlifting shoes. Everything after that is just personal preference.",1
"I agree, although I’ve tried those before and because of the heel lift, my glutes do not get activated as much as they would if I were to have a flat platform that’s parallel to the ground. I’ve found the heel lift to shift the load of the squat to my quads.",1
Feeling isn't necessarily a good indicator of that muscle being worked.,1
"which is not conducive to stability. Now I'm wondering if I should switch to Vans, and if so, which Vans are the best for squats?",1
"If you're getting to this, I would just buy a pair of squat shoes. They're helpful for bench, pressing and all squats.",1
"Depends  on your gym floor type, my old gym, socks weren't slippy at all. Current gym, they are. My solution: wearing grip socks from a trampoline park haha",1
"But when I have worn shoes to workout, I've worn my minimalist shoes (Xero). Completely flat sole, no padding or anything, and a nice wide toe box. Very comfortable as a daily wear shoes too.",1
What do you think about the reference stats for Lat Pulldown here?,1
For a 80 kg male a 1RM of 84 kg would be considered intermediate and a 1RM of 110 kg advanced. Seems a bit low to me - everyone able to do a few (say 5) pullups would nearly be considered advanced. I'm mainly asking in comparison to the other reference stats on there where I'm worse. Not that it's super important.,1
I don't think a 110kg lat pulldown would be advanced.,1
"Pull-ups can be roughly as strong as your bench, depending on the person. An advanced pullup would probably be around 130 - 140kg+.",1
"Pull-ups can be roughly as strong as your bench, depending on the person",1
Interesting comment. Bench is actually where I'm worst. Partially because my form sucked until a short while ago (getting better now) and probably because it's scarier to get close to failure there... being close to failure on Lat Pulldowns ain't no thang,1
Tbh I've been at points stronger at Pullups than bench because I focused on strongman and I've long arms.,1
"Most people probably don't put as much focus into their upper back work as they should. if they did, they'd find its roughly round the same as their chest pressing.",1
Those strength standards sites are useless.,1
How long will it take to get my physique back after a long break from the gym?,1
"I've been out for as long as I've been in due to illness. When I first started lifting and stayed consistent, my body changed a lot (measurements dropped, cellulite was gone) despite losing little weight. When I took a break, I ate exactly the same but barely even moved, so my body went back to square one (measurements increased, cellulite is back) despite only gaining 1 kg.",1
"I'm just wondering if it will take more, less or the same amount of time to get my fit body back this time around.",1
"I'm just wondering if it will take more, less or the same amount of time to get my fit body back this time around.",1
"I think many people find it easier to gain back their lost strength after long gym breaks than initially getting it. A part is probably psychological (I could life twice as much already 2 years ago!) and a part might be that you're actually already better at doing the movements correctly. I've seen numbers like ""gaining back the strength takes around half the time as initially getting it"", but obviously take that with a month's supply of salt",1
It will come back much faster this time around. I took a 1 year break during Covid and gained all my strength back within 3 months.,1
Potential Dumb effing question but bear with me. I am trying to structure my eating so I hit macros reliably and stay within a certain deficit. The only way I was able to reliably hit my protein requirements is to have a protein shake (whey isolate and 8oz milk) for breakfast daily.,1
I only lift 2x a week and run 3-4x a week. Would it still be ok to take protein supplement for breakfast on days I don’t lift?,1
"Whey protein is food. Yes, you can eat food on days you don't lift. In fact, you should actually eat food every day.",1
"Whey is just food my friend. You're growing and recovering every day, not just days you're in the gym.",1
if you aren't able to hit your protein target without it then use it every day.,1
Protein is protein whether it's in a shake or in meat.,1
Yes. It's okay to take protein supplements on your off days.,1
Thank you for indulging in my dumb question. Tomorrow I will come back with a dumber one LOL.,1
Seriously thanks!,1
"What’s the most accurate way to measure body fat? I’m a couple weeks into a cut and am down a few pounds, but my scale says by body fat % is unchanged. My lifts haven’t suffered, so I don’t think I’m losing muscle. Thanks for any advice",1
What’s the most accurate way to measure body fat?,1
"Technically an autopsy. After that, DEXA scan, but they're somewhat pricey and not accurate enough to be useful.",1
"Ultimately, you're better off going off the mirror and the bathroom scale.",1
"Lol not quite ready to die for my cut, thanks for the advice",1
"They're all inaccurate and honestly, not worth using.",1
"If you have been maintaining workouts and eating protein and not in too steep a cut (1% of your body weight lost a week is great), then you shouldn't have to worry about  losing muscle.",1
Just focus on what you look like in the mirror.,1
Among the ones that make sense in terms of cost and effort - A mirror and a caliper.,1
What makes a superset 'good'?,1
I like to superset RDLs with sumo squats for legs/glutes.,1
wear a big t-shirt like xlarge,1
"I look smaller and more average when I wear loose clothes. Anything athletic fit works, but too tight and small makes me feel silly.",1
"I’m working my way back from bad posture and I mainly did this through lifestyle/habit changes and targeted exercises for weak muscles (glutes, hams, back, abs, etc) for 3-4 months. Now I have decent posture and want to follow a real lifting program because I haven’t seen much difference in my body fat % (I’m trying to recomp) with just my own routine. Also, I need to see faster/guaranteed results within 4 months.",1
"But these programs typically are push pull legs, and I do enough ‘pushing’ in my everyday life due to my career (sitting, desk job, etc) that I don’t want to further strengthen the muscles that support bad posture. If I skipped push and only did pull, would that still be ok or would that really reduce results in terms of body fat?",1
"Btw I’m 21F and a relative beginner. My main aesthetic goals are to lose body fat (skinny fat), and be lean but have muscle so the ‘toned’ look. I’m happy with how my legs and butt look rn and don’t really want to grow them more; I just want to make sure everything is strong enough to maintain good posture.",1
You are NOT doing enough pushing in your daily life if you work a desk job! You should follow a program as written and work out your full body.,1
"Trying to recomp is extremely slow. If you are truly skinny fat (aka, you are a lean weight but still look like you have fat) then you should be focusing on trying to build muscle first. The more effective way to do this is to bulk. You don't have to go crazy and gain 1+lbs each week, you can keep this slower. But bulk, high protein (.8-1g protein per 1lb body weight) and sticking to a proven workout routine (like on the wiki) will give you the best results. Gain about 10lbs and then drop into a calorie deficit (while maintaining working out and protein intake) and drop those 10lbs. You'll look MUCH different and it'll be much faster than trying to recomp it.",1
"Your push muscles aren't strong from working at a desk, they're just shortened. If you want better posture you need to push and pull to promote proper shoulder and upper back motion.",1
What was your question?,1
Does anybody know any cardio workouts that can decrease fat while keeping muscle? I’ve been on a weight gain plan and it’s working really well but I’m also concerned about fat gain. I want to lose the fat but keep the weight. Any recommendations?,1
You're not going to lose fat following a weight gaining diet.,1
You're also not going to lose (significant amounts of) fat while keeping your weight the same.,1
You lose fat via a sustained cardio deficit.  https://thefitness.wiki/weight-loss-101/,1
"My goal is to build as much muscle as possible as fast as possible. Are free weights, weight machines or calisthenics right for me? I could conceivable do any of the three.",1
"I’ve read that free weights are best for muscle growth and maximising newbie gains. However my parents are hesitant and worried I’ll hurt myself since I had never stepped foot in a gym until three weeks ago and won’t have a spotter. They want me to wait an entire year until I am at university for me to do free weights. Is this at all reasonable of them, and will using only machines reduce how quickly I gain muscle?",1
My plan is to do weight training (free or machines) three times a week. Is full body three times a week enough?,1
Do all three. I don't know why it has to be either/or. Just follow a program from the wiki.,1
"I don't believe so, but that's up to you to convince them otherwise.",1
"Yes. Consistency, time and effort are the three main factors.",1
"How long can you drop out of zone 2 cardio without negating the specific benefits it gives to mitochondria? So the requirement is to get bare minimum of 45 minutes for it to be effective. Say you're hiking or biking in hilly or mountainous terrain, as I do, and you have a downhill stretch that requires much less effort and lasts for say, 5 or 10 or 15 minutes, etc.--at what point will that be too much? In which case I assume you'd have to start the clock over, right?",1
"** Note to mods: this was nixed as a primary question, I hope you will allow it to stay here for those of us for whom this is an important question. Certainly it is for me, and I'd think there may be others who will search for this in the future. Thanks!",1

I’m a college student struggling to get enough daily fiber from the dining hall. Before you guys tell me fiber is better from real food: I know. But if that’s not an option does a fiber supplement powder still get the job done?,1
Are you not eating fruits and veggies?,1
The only veggies they offer are either boiled in water or a salad bar. So I have a spinach salad every-other day. The “fruit” is a singular bowl on a rotation of apples/oranges/bananas. I’m not a big apple guy and you could play softball with the oranges they give us so I have a banana whenever they’re put out. I take vitamins to try and make up for the lack of nutrients.,1
I'd just try and stomach some of the veggies or have a side salad every meal.,1
"If you like oranges, I'd grab an orange and take it out with you. Let it ripen longer in your room.",1
"Another option, if you're allowed microwaves in your room, you can get veggies yourself and a microwave steamer basket and make some veggies yourself. That's probably what I would do if I really couldn't stomach the school's veggies because even with vitamins, I start feeling like shit if I don't get my veggies in.",1
"Otherwise, you can get some psyllium husk fiber supplements. I believe there is a powder form, but I've tried the capsules before. I was attempting to get better bowel movements and my doc recommended them. It didn't help me BUT I also didn't think it was fiber related due to how many veggies I do eat. The dose is like 4-5 caps per meal essentially. So just find the cheap ones (I just got the target branded ones) cus you can get through them quick.",1
"New job got in the way od my already Casual aproach to lifting. I work 12 Hours Shift, Monday to Wednesday/thursday. That leaves mě 3 or 4 days off to lift. And i have no idea what program i should use since i have maybe 40-50 min for training considering shower/travel. Hour top. Or if i should lift 3 days straight, And dont care about recovery. I dont want to train home with kettlebell. Thoughts?",1
"If you're smart about it, you could run something like 5/3/1 For Beginners three days in a row.",1
"Thoughts on the guidance around 1g protein per lb? I find this pretty hard and expensive to accomplish every day, but I work out hard and probably get between 60-100g daily. Am I missing out on results?",1
"At 60-100, probably missing out some, especially on the lower end. But you don't need 160. 120 or so would be fine",1
"In the Macrofactor app, I set my protein target to be the ""low end"" of the optimal range. The recommendation comes out to 0.64g/lb of bodyweight when my goal is building muscle.",1
"The middle of the optimal range, according to the app, is 0.8g/lb.",1
"Personally, I see no need for me to consume more than that.",1
"1,4-2,2g/kg of bodyweight work fine.",1
"So for you, 100g per would be on the lower end of that spectrum. With that in mind, you are maybe missing out on some results.",1
It’s a lofty goal but is physically possible and very effective,1
1g per pound of lean mass.,1
At your bodyweight I would probably aim for 120g daily and call it a day. That's pretty much smack dab in the middle of the recommended range.,1
If you cap out at 100g on a good day and are getting less than that regularly you probably are missing out on some gains.,1
It's an easy to remember number on the upper side of a broad range that works.,1
We don't know what you're missing out on.  Try different things and see how you respond.,1
Do you have a question?,1
"If you are looking for a program review, please read the posting guidelines. Your post lacks required information.",1

If you want to go back to oly lifting why not just run the beginners program from catalyst?,1
After 5 months of cutting I finally got my DEXA scan. I went from 176lb @ 21.2%bf to 158lb @ 15.2%bf. My goal was <15%bf but it seems i didn't quite hit it....,1
"Originally when i calculated out my weight at  15% bf it was 163lb, but i realized much later that that would only be correct if i lost zero muscle. According to the scan results i lost 4.6lb of lean tissue, and i lost 13.2lb of fat tissue.",1
I was trying as much as i could to eat enough protein. I drank two scoops of protein shake 4 days/week and ate basically nothing but chicken or fish for 95%. of my meals.,1
"I have definitely noticed a loss of strength, my squats and deadlifts have stalled and my bench and OHP dropped a bit",1
Here are some of my latest 5RM tests:Squat: 175lbDead: 235lbBench: 180lbOHP: 115lb,1
"I know these aren't great, especially the squat and dead which I think are suffering due to poor form, i'm planning on getting a professional trainer to coach me on those lifts",1
"I want to start bulking but at my current 15.2%bf i'm worried if i try to bulk, i'll just end up back where i started with 21.2%bf, and i'll be stuck in a cycle without ever getting my bf down or my lifts up.",1
"What do you all think i should do? My original plan was to get this DEXA scan, then start bulking for 3-4months, then cut before summer hits.",1
Ideally i'd like to be a in a place where i'm hovering between 12-15% bf and able to grow muscle without getting too fat.,1
"Note that I'm still relatively a novice lifter, i only started in April 2022, i lifted without paying attention to BF for ~4 months, and then in August 2022 when i got my first dexa scan i decided i wanted to look better, so i began cutting while still doing my normal lifting routine (GZCLP).",1
"I want to start bulking but at my current 15.2%bf i'm worried if i try to bulk, i'll just end up back where i started with 21.2%bf, and i'll be stuck in a cycle without ever getting my bf down or my lifts up.",1
"You're going to gain some fat during a bulk, the point is to have more muscle underneath it each time you start your cut. Bulking with a smaller surplus and being diligent about tracking your intake can mitigate it a bit.",1

"So technically I started lifting around the 26th of December but I was hit by severe DOMS so I really first started 2nd of January, where I also began taking creatine.",1
"Never lifted in my life previously and I weighed in at around 71.2kg on the 2nd of January. I'm a 175 cm male, 28 years old.",1
"To my surprise, my scale and app says that these are the changes in my body composition from 2nd of January -> 9th, can this really be accurate lol? Water weight also increased from 53% to roughly 56% during the same period which is probably the creatine. 2.7% drop in BF and a 1.2% increase in muscle mass? The hell.",1
Ignore anything a scale tells you except for your bodyweight. Everything else is at best a rough estimate.,1
"Without even looking at the picture, they are NOT accurate at all. Hydration and what food you have in your bowels can change the readings on these scales.",1
I had a scale said I lost like 10lbs of lean mass in a year after I visibly built a ton of muscle. It's all bullshit.,1
"I figured as much, but I assume the water weight increase should be correct considering I've been loading creatine for an entire week (20g a day), which is probably the reason for the big weight jump. The rest is irrelevant then? I mean I probably did put on some muscle, but yeah there is no way I lost almost 3% BF and put on 1.2kg of muscle mass in 10 days obviously.",1
Don't load creatine. Just start taking 5g/day and do that for life (or as long as you can afford it).,1
"You didn't need to actually load creatine, but yeah, that is def one reason for the weight jump.",1
"But muscle building is extremely slow, so 1.2kg of muscle in 10 days is very unlikely.",1
"So yeah, just ignore everything. Watch your weight and make it do what you want it to do with your diet (obv, creatine DOES skew this, but that should be over now at this point). And if your weights are going up in the gym, you're building muscle. And if you start to look a bit doughy/squishy, its time for a cut.",1
Any device that claims to measure body fat or muscle mass is incorrect.,1
"Do you guys absolutely recommend T test? I've been eating within macros. No sugar and hardly any junk, and trying to bulk by lifting 3-4x a week consistently since 4 months or more, was on a cut before that. And I've hardly gained any muscle I think. Lifts are going up, but no physical changes.",1

Can you really progress and get good results with this beginner program from the wiki :,1
""" Workout A",1
Squats : 3×8-10 Bench Press : 3×8-10 Rows : 3×8-10,1
Workout B,1
"Deadlifts : 3×6-8 Pull-Ups or : 3×8-10 Shoulder Press : 3×8-10 """,1
"Also, will this program make my arms grow or no ? There's no arms exercises or anything.",1
"I also replaced the Pulls up with Lat Pull-Downs, the Rows with Seated Rows, the Shoulder Press with the Shoulder Press machine, and the Bench Press with a Chest press machine, is that okay ?",1
You can get results with that program.,1
Your arms would grow with that program.,1
I would not find those substitutions ok.,1
Why ?,1
"The program is a limited program.  It has few movements.  Those few movements are selected because they have a lot of ""bang for their buck"".  Free weight movements will improve coordination and stabilization in a way that machines will not, as the feature of machines is that they take that aspect AWAY from the movement.",1
"Bench press, rows, pull ups and shoulder press are all arm exercises.",1
"I also replaced the Pulls up with Lat Pull-Downs,",1
"The wiki page discusses what you can do if you can't do pull ups.  If you can do pull ups, I wouldn't replace these.",1
"I wouldn't make any of the other changes because one of the main purposes of the beginner's routine is to teach you to ""start training with the standard barbell lifts.""",1
"But I've already done some of them before, my gym is crowded af sometimes and there's like one bench and 2-3 barbells ( most of the time they're being used) , while there's less people on the machines, so that's why I wanted to replace some of them.",1
"I also don't like Rows, that's why I wanted to do Seated Row on a machine instead",1
I personally wouldn't consider those good enough reasons to change the routine.,1
The wiki page for that program should answer all of your questions.,1
It's meant to introduce you to all of the barbell lifts - so replacing them with machines defeats that purpose. You run it for a few months then graduate to a more comprehensive program.,1
"I've already done Bench Press and the other stuff before, the gym is just SO crowded and we got like one bench only, and 3 barbells bruh",1
Why do I feel a Deadlift discomfort when lowering the barbell down? I'm scared of doing the Deadlift wrong and I can't even tell if it's wrong form or nah,1

"aight I'll try to record it next time ! But I asked about my form to a jacked guy in my gym and he said I was doing it correctly, but we never know",1
Brace your core and keep it braced whenever the bar is in motion. Don't relax on eccentric.,1
You don't have to lower it SLOWLY. Just keep some control and don't let it completely crash down.,1
Make sure you're lowering in the reverse technique of how you hinged it upwards.,1

Elliptical vs treadmill for cardio after a workout. Does it matter or I'd one better than the other? Some say nothing beats the treadmill. Running is the best etc.,1

"I can't help it, sometimes I get weak if I don't eat, or I get hungry.",1
Think about calories as a weekly average with regards to weight change.,1
Eating 6 days in a 100 calorie deficit then overeating 600 calories is effectively the same as eating every day with no deficit.,1

If I hold out my arms forward (so without a barbell) I can easily squat deep enough. I have to have a fairly wide stance (more than shoulder width) with feet pointed outward about 30 degrees to be able to do it, with the barbell resting on my traps.",1
Can you do Dumbbell goblet squats with no issue?,1
"Are you letting your knees travel forward? Tipping backwards happens simply because your center of mass changes. When squatting with arms forward, your arms counterbalance you. When squatting with a bar you either have to bend over a lot or let your knees travel forward. Staying upright means letting your knees travel forward, keeping your knees back or lacking ankle mobility means bending at the hips a lot, but if you also lack hip mobility, you fall backwards or round your back.",1

"More info: I have lower back issues so I use the elliptical for cardio as it is low impact. I can start running once I get down to close to 200 lbs. I used to train in MMA and did a lot of fighting in my teens, it makes me want to go hard all the time which sometimes leads to injury. I am working up to hopefully doing a flag pole. If any of my sets I can do for a whole week without needing a break, then I move on to a harder exercise or a bigger set.",1
I'd drop what you're doing now and jump on a proven routine from the wiki instead.,1
"Using weights and lifting with a proper full body routine won't make you a body builder, but it will get you to your goals way faster than what you're doing.",1
"Also, I would move cardio to the end of your workouts instead of starting out with 15 mins going hard on the elliptical.",1
"Also, since you're in a calorie deficit, it does make it a bit harder to recover. Make sure you're getting your protein in though, as that will be the most helpful thing towards your recovery. Also hydrate! You should probably be getting over a gallon of water (/non-alcoholic liquid) a day.",1
"Way too much volume. 15 minutes of hardcore cardio before your workout is way too much, 5 minutes to warm up is good enough. 3 sets of 30 assisted pull-ups? Why so many? 3 sets of 8 - 12 is more than enough.",1
"Would a routine of 3-4 times a week, 3-5 sets (starting with 3 and doing more as I'm able) of pullups > squats > pushups > plank (little to no break between exercises, 1:30 between sets is what I'm capable of right now) be good for general health, stability/posture and losing weight? about 2-3 reps / 20%-ish short of max reps/time per set. Of course increasing numbers and/or sets as it gets easier.",1
"I'm 24M, 85kg, 1.76m.",1
"That and maybe 1-2 35~ minute brisk walks per week. Or maybe replacing the walks with the above routine? I just want to get the physical exercise I need out of the way and try to cover most/all of my bases - feeling better, some amount of cardio, stability/posture, weight loss, etc. Looking better would be nice. I just wanna be a healthy young dude and have a simple ""low-maintenance"" routine.",1
"I'm not looking to make a whole lifestyle out of it, I've tried a bunch of stuff before and nothing stuck but taking these walks like 3-4 times a week has stuck so far - about a month, which is good by my standards.",1
"As a side question, would doing something like the above with a weight vest (eventually) help build muscle? I ask cause weightlifting seems way too micro-managy for me but I might wanna focus more on looks in the future, and this seems like a simple solution.",1
I wanna know that I won't be setting myself up for imbalances/issues/injuries in the future with this.,1
Should I add an arm day to my upper/lower 4 times a week routine ?,1
"I started working out 4 months ago and I noticed that my arms and aren’t growing as fast as the rest of my body , so if I add another day just for arms will that help with their growth or would it do more harm than good?",1
Just add a couple extra sets on your regular workout days.,1
Can anyone name what machine this is?,1
It looks like a standing lateral raise machine but you can adjust the start points so you can do whatever the opposite of a lateral raise is (starting point lateral raise and finishing by you sides).,1
Its in my gym but I cannot remember the name. I did the above exercise and felt it targeted my chest alot.,1
Does anyone else have on and off shoulder impingement issues? I went to a PT top resolve it over the summer and now its back again (but definitely not as severe as last time). I did a lot of research on each lift to make sure I'm lifting properly so I'm not sure what's causing it. Its been on/off the past month so its kind of strange.,1
What do you mean by unilateral program? Do you mean every exercise is unilateral?,1
I would just follow a regular program and swap out the lifts you need to.,1
Do yous hit anterior delts and posterior delts when hitting your delts? Or just the medial aspect? I feel like you might not need to hit them because they get stimulated when you hit chest or back. So do yous think hitting medial delts only are enough?,1
"Is the exercise bike a valid form of cardio compared to machines like the stair master/treadmill/elliptical? It always feels like I’m not exerting myself as much on the exercise bike, even when my heart rate is going high- but I enjoy the bike due to its low impact on knees and feet.",1
Valid. Also don't underestimate the importance of enjoyment. You will always do more effort if you enjoy what you are doing.,1
"They are all different, but valid forms of cardio.",1
"If your heart rate is in the correct zone, it’s valid",1
"It's valid, but it is different.  Because you're seated, your heart rate will be lower at a similar effort compared to an exercise where your legs are supporting your body.",1
If it works for you it works for you.,1
Do I need to do hammer/crossbody curls every time I work biceps?,1
nope!,1
"Hi! I’m experiencing this issue where I don’t feel any significant or any at all tension on my bicep when doing bicep exercises. I’ve been doing the standing dumbbell bicep curl and preacher curl for about 2-3 weeks now and only feel the most tension on my forearms during and post workout. I’ve tried alternating the weight from 15 to 25 (the max I can carry) to see weight is the issue. I also try my best to mimic the correct form on the exercises from demonstrations online. Is this normal? If not, what should I do?",1
"You may just have weak forearms. If you are doing a bicep curl, you are using your bicep.",1
i joined a boxing gym and love it.  the cardio and conditioning are amazing.,1
I am however a bit concerned that im loosing some muscle mass / strength.  I wanted to some how incorporate strength/power into my week with something like 5x5's or 531 - i just dont know how.,1
"I cant find anything anywhere on combining two completely different work outs.  I like the feeling i get from big lifts of being powerful and explosive and i like how i look.  but i dont want to stop boxing.  maybe im thinking of the impossible, i dont know.",1
"Im at the boxing gym 3-4 times a week, and would love if i could get in even just 2 days of big lifts somewhere.",1
any thoughts?,1
How can I add bench 3x a week doing Arnold split? Chest has been improving everytime I train it and I want to do more so on what days can I add it to?,1
Counterpoint:  Don't try to fix something that isn't broken.,1
The Arnold Split I just looked up on the wiki surely doesn't need more volume added to it. Especially not if you are natural.,1
"You might wanna take a look on some offseason powerlifting plans/general strength plans, as they probably offer more chest frequency, up to 4x a week.",1
If you're making progress stick to what you're doing until you stop making progress.,1
Doing more wont necessarily mean getting better progress.,1
"6'2 + 203 pounds. 18 days into a cut. Workout 2x a day everyday, tracking & eating 1900-2100 calories a day depending on how hungry I get. Not expecting to lose 10 pounds a week, but the scale has barely moved. Getting discouraged already because of the work and discipline I'm putting in. Should I lower my calories? Or should I up my calories? Reading that if you go too low then the body holds on to weight? Not sure if that's true. Appreciate anyone helping out on this, thanks.",1
"Looking at a TDEE calculator, your TDEE is estimated at about 2300 calories. It may be a little higher depending on your workouts, but actually lifting weights doesn't burn all that much really, and it depends on how long your workouts are.",1
"So at 2100 calories, you're in a 200 calorie deficit. That's not much. 1900 is a bit better. So as is, if you haven't seen the scale move, I'd evaluate how you're tracking things, double and triple check the calories. If you aren't using a food scale, use a food scale as it's WAY more accurate than trying to use measuring cups. Track all oils/fats you cook in. And if you're eating out, stop it cus thats way harder to track (I wouldn't trust their calorie estimates).",1
"And if you are 100% sure you're tracking correctly, start eating in a 1700-1900 calorie range. Make sure you're placing an emphasis on protein and fats earlier in the day, anything carb heavy (like potato, rice, etc) in the evening to help avoid the hunger that sometimes can follow eating heavy carb.",1
"And for your 2x a day workout... don't burn yourself out. Go for a daily walk sure, but more time in the gym doesn't mean better. Trying to out workout/run a diet is just gonna burn yourself out.",1
Or should I up my calories? Reading that if you go too low then the body holds on to weight?,1
"This is bullshit. If you eat like shit for a prolonged period of time, you may lower your metabolism because of a lack of nutrients or something. Your body basically isn't healthy and so it's trying to survive on lower calories. But spending 18 days in a ""cut"" and not losing weight is not gonna cause you to hold onto weight.  Now you don't wanna go too low too fast. If you were maintaining on like 3500 calories and you start your diet at 2000 calories, that's gonna be a shock and your body will get use to eating 2000 calories eventually, but if you started your diet at 3000 and then when that became closer to maintainace, you lowered from there, you'd be better off. This doesn't seem to be your issue though.",1
So basically... you're eating too much.,1
"Being 18 days into a cut means you aren't holding much diet fatigue. If you were dieting for 2 months, a diet break -> eating at maintenance could be beneficial.",1
How many steps a day do you get? What type of workouts are you doing 2x a day? Calorie amount would seem to be appropriate for losing weight with your parameters. Any chance of error in calorie counting? Otherwise the obvious answer is to either lower calories or get more steps. Eating more definitely wont result in losing weight.,1
It’s okay if I’m not getting sore anymore or am I not going hard enough? I enjoyed the feeling.,1
Muscle soreness is not a good indication of muscle growth. It is definetely not needed to get results.,1
Its fine.  Soreness usually lessens a lot of goes away completely as you get used to the exercises.,1
Are you making progress towards your goal(s)?,1
"Its normal. Eventually as you push up against your limit/learn how to train even harder, soreness will appear again, though not quite as drastically.",1
Short version: how can I focus on working a single one of my arms that's weaker than the other?,1
"Long version: when I played football in high school (a little over a decade ago), I had a recurring shoulder injury that was never diagnosed or treated where it felt like my shoulder would pop out of its socket and then go right back in, leaving my arm numb and weak for ten minutes or so before returning to normal. This happened maybe two dozen times when I was in high school, never really affecting me for more than that ten minutes. Now, as I'm working out years later, that shoulder hurts quite a bit if I do a lift that puts strain on it, and the result, somehow, is that my right triceps are considerably and visibly weaker than my left. How can I address this?",1
"Probably should see a doc about that injury, even though its a decade ago.",1
But do single arm work and start with your weaker arm. Match that effort on your strong arm and eventually they'll even out.,1
"100% You should go check out a physical therapist. I have a rebuilt right shoulder, I've torn both labrums, dislocated my ac joints, etc. If it's a shoulder issue you can have, I've pretty well got it.",1
"The biggest help has been working with my orthopedist (who has a sports medicine background) and my physical therapist (who works with collegiate athletes). It took some time to find these folks, but once I did, we made big strides in my shoulder health & strength.",1
"Would training your foremans, biceps, or triceps in isolation help with improving grip strength or stabilization of other compound lifts.",1
"I'm looking for a reason to train my arms I train every other muscle pretty much calfs, quads, hams, abs, back, chest, shoulders, but training my arms is something I'm super lazy about.",1
Triceps can be a significant limiting factor in bench press if you don't train them. I only train my biceps because my elbows tend to get painful when I stop doing curls.,1
"Triceps will help with things like OHP and bench, among other similar lifts. Forearms would in theory help with anything pulling related, like multiple sets of pull ups, deadlifts, etc. Biceps would I guess help with motions like rows and whatnot, but I'm sure that'd be marginal.",1
"Triceps will most likely provide the most benefit overall. You can always wear straps to help with grip strength, as most lifts will progress faster than you can develop your grip. Think adding 5-10lbs every week to your dead lift as being realistic, but adding 20-40lbs to you grip in a month vs a deadlift would be insane. Triceps are generally 2/3rds of your arms mass, so they do some work, plus all the lockout stuff for OHP/bench. After a few weeks of just blasting my triceps, I found it much easier to recruit them during bench press.",1
"Your forearm are the only thing that matters for grip strength. If you care about it train them. There are good routines at r/GripTraining. If you don't care, just use straps.",1
Triceps is one of the main movers for any press you do. That alone is a good reason to train them properly with isolation.,1
Is it bad to have sore muscles more than a week ? I'm beginner and trained back a week ago. Its not my first time training back but its the first time I used a a different technique that was told me so I wouldn't use my biceps or other muscles during the excercise but use my back musckes ( before I never felt it in my back ). Its not a disturbing pain I only feel it when I turn / strecht my upper body to the right then I feel a kind of soreness in my left lat. Is this a bad sign ? should I ask a doctor or just wait it out ?,1
DOMS can take 8-10 days to subside completely.,1
"If it doesn't go away after that or becomes sharper, look for a doctor.",1
Yes it's normal to be sore especially since you're not used to working out. Your back muscles are pretty big so they're usually sore for a long time. I once had sore calves for 3 weeks following a mile run,1
"Basically sit on my ass all day long when I'm not lifting, thought of simply doing 60 mins on the stairs daily, or should I stick to incline treadmill?",1
I am doing normal cardio on off days.,1
Any recommendations to find solid quality home gym stuff that won't drain my bank account,1
"Everything is more expensive now, but I went with Rep Fitness when I built my home gym. The 1000 series racks are basic but solid, their flat bench is really good quality, and their metal plates were cheaper than other sites I looked at. Bar I went with a Rogue Ohio Power Bar, since it was the best bang for the buck. Other option is to start building it over time via Craigslist/FB Marketplace. Also, check out r/homegym.",1
Titan has some of the more affordable prices from a major retailer. Quality won't be as crisp as something like Rogue but everything I've bought from them has been decent. Here's a $150 Power Bar for example. (doublecheck specifications on everything to make sure it's up to standards) You can also get their much cheaper axle for bench/deadlift work and just build up a killer grip.,1
Look for used deals if you want cheaper. I also picked up some cheap plates from a local manufacturer and didn't have to pay shipping so you could look for something similar.,1
Titan and Rep Fitness both make good equipment that is affordable. Used equipment will always be the cheapest but can be hard to find.,1
check out Garage Gym Reviews on youtube and their website for affordable home gym recommendations,1
"best way is to find someone selling all their stuff on craigslist/fb marketplace.   I got a bar, weights, rack and bench for like $300 in 2020.  it was all very shitty but weight is weight.  Now the only thing I still have from that haul is the weights cause like, having nice stuff is nice.",1
"about 3.5 months into my weightlifting/fitness journey and dealing with my first major hurdle - shoulder pain. it almost feels like a rotator cuff issue? minor pain/burning sensation when moving my right arm around, feels mostly fine when not being used. anyone deal with this and maybe have some tips to a. resolve the pain b. avoid making it worse moving forward?",1
My tip would be to seek the help of a professional that can diagnose the issue in person.,1
"As someone who has basically never worked out and spend all day at the pc I have basically no muscle. I have recently started working out but have trouble feeling like im activating muscles like my chest. Do I have to get my arms stronger before i can start using my chest properly? I feel like no matter what excercise i do, even on machines i mostly hit biceps.",1
"If you are performing a horizontal pressing motion, you are using your chest muscles. When starting out it's not unusual to not feel the muscles used, especially during compound movements. With time it gets better.",1
You don't have to get stronger arms to train your chest. Just keep on training.,1
"in my experience I didnt start feeling certain muscles working until I actually made them bigger, but I didnt need to feel them working in order to make them bigger, if that makes sense",1
"I used to have no chest at all, so doing chest workouts I wouldnt feel anything in my chest, because it was small and weak. Now that its bigger I can actually feel it working more. But I was still able to grow it without really feeling it.",1
"As others have mentioned, you cannot do an exercise without using the muscles required to do that exercise",1
"Been working out since last 3 weeks, I lift alternate days and on rest days I play tennis/racquetball. I have noticed my body doesn't fully recover and remains sore for next lifting day, even though I am lifting alternate days.  Should I stop playing sports on rest days? any supplements which can expedite recovery?",1
"Soreness on it's own doesn't really mean much, especially so early in the game.",1
Are you eating enough?  Drinking enough? Sleeping enough?,1
Are you simply doing too much in the gym?,1
"It's only been three weeks, you're probably still just getting used to the schedule. If it's not having a major negative impact on your lifting I wouldn't worry about it. Like eric said, just make sure that your sleep/diet/etc. are in line.",1
"Do you find that your resting heart rate tends to go up on hypertrophy routines? My RHR was in the high 50s-low 60s for November and December, but now it’s crept up to ~65",1
"No, but it does usually go up with bodyweight. If you have started training recently and started eating more and gained weight, that's probably the answer.",1
Mine goes up with hard training of any kind. Intensity seems to affect it more than volume though.,1
"As long as you want, but I think you're well outside calling this a mini cut.",1
"Does anyone know of a good electrolyte supplement that doesn't cost an arm and a leg? Brands like Liquid IV and Primal Harvest cost about $1.50+ per ""serving"".",1
"Unless you do subscribe and save, the packets I get (LMNT) are also $1.50 a serving.  Which to me is fine because I only use 1-2 a week as I only use them on my long bike rides. In the winter, I mostly use them cus they're tasty, but in the summer, it's helped some in avoiding massive headaches after 2-3 hour rides in the heat.",1
Most people don't need electrolyte mixes just for a normal workout. Just salt your food and eat a varied diet and you should be fine.,1
What exercises can I do if I injured my left wrist? I can’t really bend it at all without it hurting..,1
I accidentally smashed my wrist against some plates when warming up and now it hurts when I am trying to bend it like 30 degree since the beginning of last week…,1
I didn’t train push for the past week but I don’t want to continue not training push…,1
You could use cuffs on your forearms for fly motions and lateral raises. Can't think of any reasonable way to actually press without loading your wrist. Also the obligatory go see a doctor.,1
Rule 5. Ask your doctor.,1
"Should i do a beginner ppl? I did greyskull a few years ago and saw some good noob gains (started off barely benching the bar and got to 145 for 5 reps eventually) but haven't lifted for a while now so my stats are:,",1
Bench/squat/deadlift 1rm 130/200/225,1
"BUT I'm very skinny still (5' 11"" and 130 lbs) and would like to gain a lot more muscle, especially in my upper body / arms. I look like a prime ""do you even lift"" candidate right now. So I'm considering doing metallaicadpa ppl which is designed for beginners so i can bulk up a bit.",1
"My concern is I'm not quite a beginner (bench 1rm = body weight, squat and dl close to 1.5x bodyweight) so maybe i will stall out quickly in the beginner ppl and I should choose a different program?",1
Appreciate any advice and it would be great to hear from people who were in a similar situation. Thank you.,1
"It's a program with a limited shelf life.  You can run it if you want and just hop off sooner than a pure beginner.  Or you can find another program with a more sustainable progression.  GZCL, Stronger by Science, 5/3/1, whatever.",1
"Either way, you're going to end up in the same place.",1
Do you need to progressive overload abs or is it enough to train to failure each time?,1
Doing only one or the other would mean that you make no progress. I don't think you understand the question you asked.,1
"Any suggestions for an experienced lifter who hasn't touched a weight in a few years to get back into it? I'm still somewhat strong but definitely overweight and have no endurance, do I treat myself as ""untrained"" to start or go right back into more intermediate programming? I went back in today for the first time just to move a little, and the soreness is very real right off the bat",1
"Start at the beginning, progress as you will, and adjust as needed.",1
You’re a beginner again but you get to speedrun it this time. :),1
"Been wanting to switch my leg day routine, so I been watching videos and looking up routines from people. A common thing I’m seeing is of people doing isolation exercises like calves and quads before doing their big compound like squats.",1
Is there a reason for this? I thought you would want to do your compounds first when you have the most energy and power in your body.,1
"You do things in order of priority.  Absent that, generally you start with the big, systemic stuff first (e.g. heavy compounds) and work your way down.",1
"If you have prioritize calves over everything else, then you would do that first so you can give them your all.   You can prioritize quads by doing extension first, which has the secondary benefit of 'pre-fatiguing' them for squats so that the squats are limited by and (hopefully) more stimulating for your quads.",1
Programming is all about priorities and desired outcomes.,1
I'm new to going to the gym and I've been going every other day and was wondering how i should structure my workout routine.  here it is.,1
(Day 1) Chest triceps  (Day 2)*rest*  (Day 3) Legs (Day 4) *rest* (Day 5) back biceps (Day 6) *rest* (Day 7) Legs,1
that's just a list of body parts.,1
Pick one of these with the structure already figured out for you.,1

Thanks bro,1
"Is progressive overload something i need to be focused on every time I'm in the gym? Or as long as im focusing on hypertrophy in each session, progressive overload will naturally come over time?",1
Progressive overload in the foundation of everything.  You cannot 'focus on hypertrophy' without incorporating progress overload from the beginning.  It doesn't just happen.,1
Progressive overload is both the goal of training and the result of training.  Good programs have a method of progression that both informs you how to progress from workout to workout but also results in progress.  Not every method of progression is linear (more weight or more reps than last time) and I'd say progress almost always happens non-linearly.,1
"How important are deadlifts? No deadlift platform at my college gym, so I skip out on them for leg day and hit machines instead. Am I missing out on a lot?",1
You don't need a deadlift platform to deadlift.,1
I have never deadlifted on a deadlift platform.,1
"Do your gym gave yoga mats and a floor? If so just put the mats under where the weights go, and lift from there. The deadlift does work a lot of muscles at the same time, and is widely regarded as one of the best free weight exercises you can do.",1
What are you going to do with the answer?,1
"They hit your lower back muscles (spinal erectors if i recall) better than any other exercises. Its an exercise where u can load very very heavy, which can only be amazing for all the others muscles used in the exercise in terms of gains (traps, lats, glutes, hamstrings, forearms, grip strength).",1
Definitely can be taken out of your program but you would at least need another lower back exercise,1
"How long does muscle memory last? Used to be relatively muscular 2.5 years ago but stopped working out, can I gain it back quickly?",1
I didn’t lift between the ages of 18 to 42. Started lifting again at 42 and my size and strength blew up in no time. 2.5 years shouldn’t be a problem.,1
The only way to get a real answer is to get in the gym and find out.,1
can I gain it back quickly?,1
Start training and report back with your findings.,1
"I am wondering which of the scenarios is best for lowering my resting heart rate (I have 58 now, but I want it down. Why? Just a milestone to motivate me to continue my road to better health);",1
"1 hour of stationary bike (zone 2) 5 times a week, or 2 hours of stationary bike (zone 2) 3 times a week.",1
Or maybe some other tips? Preferably on a stationary bike.,1
"I don't know specifically about lowering heart rate but most good running training plans (which are specifically designed to improve the aerobic capacity of your body) are based on the total miles you run during the week but they also have one day specifically devoted to a longer run than the others days.  So if you were running 30 miles per week, you might have 1 run that is 10 miles and then 3 or 4 more runs during the week that are 3-6 miles long.  Usually total miles is the most important thing but the long run is a key part of the plan.  My intuition tells me that the more time you spend doing aerobic exercise the lower your RHR will be.  How you split that up may have some effect but is probably secondary.",1
"Anecdotally, the lowest my heart rate has been is when I was running 25 miles per week (similar to above with 1 long run and a few shorter runs during the week).  But in addition to doing that, my wife and I started to walk at minimum 4 miles a day.  After a month or more of running + walking my heart rate dropped to the lower 50's if I recall correctly.  From memory, I probably had 4 hrs running per week (mostly around 140 HR) and 7+ hrs of walking per week (mostly around 110 HR)",1
"Combine them, do 3x1h and 1x2h.",1
"As a reference, I used to run a lot (2600mi in 2022) and in about 6 years my resting HR went from 58 to 42-43. When I stopped running it went back to about 50.",1
"But I think what would help you instead of just chasing a number, is to have a wider goal. Do you want to see yourself as a cyclist? Maybe cycling with other people?",1
FWIW 58 is a great resting heart rate. Too low of a resting HR can actually be bad,1
"When I flex my glutes (mostly outer) while sitting, especially sitting while doing leg extensions, my legs shake like crazy. There’s a muscle weakness right? Where would that be? I have weak hip/outer quad muscles",1
"it's normal to shake from exertion, but if you're specifically flexing your glutes then the 'weakness' would be in the glutes.  but I wouldn't diagnose anything off this unless you're training for some sort of glute flexing competition.",1
Any good online communities you would recommend to find a personal trainer?,1
"Hey all, I’m going to start going to the gym next week but I have no clue what I should be taking with me and what shoes I should wear. I won’t really be doing any lifting.",1

Did cable bicep curls today at setting #4 but like a noob didn’t see what the pounds were.,1
Any chance they are standard? How many pounds is “4 little plates” on the cable machine?,1
Thanks for any help.,1
There is no standard.,1
Thanks- I’ll be better about looking at the machine.,1
"The labeling on a cable machine isn't even standard. It may say 25 on the plate, but that may not even correspond to another machines 25.",1
Why does it matter?,1
Is StrongLifts a good option for quickly increasing my lifts if I don’t mind more improvement in my lower body lifts than in my bench? (my squat/DL numbers are very low but my bench is ok since I come from calisthenics),1
Personally I'd go with GZCLP or the beginner's routine in the wiki.,1
That's the purpose of any linear progression program.  But it's only a good option for a long as it works.,1
"What was your diet and eating habits like this past holiday period?Just curious, did your diet change dramatically. I was eating carbs all day until the new year",1
"I ate what I wanted when it sounded good. I didn't aim to splurge. If something was offered and sounded good, I ate it.",1
How you eat between Thanksgiving & New Years is decently inconsequential compared to New Years to Thanksgiving.,1
"I bulked for the holidays, so I didn't give my diet a tremendous amount of thought. I did make a point of pushing cardio hard during the two weeks surrounding Christmas and NY.",1
Should I lower the weights for my next workout tomorrow because I train 6 times a week but I've missed the last 3 days (half of my training program) since I was sick and I don't know if the intensity should be the same as it usually is? Thanks in advance.,1
I would just plan to do the stated workout and adjust anything that needs it in the moment.,1
That why I'll probably do. If I feel I can't lift the same weights I used to one week I'll just lower them and progressively overload them,1
Am I able to OH Press with a SSB?,1
Is there any negative with using this bar for a period time of time for OH Pressing?,1

"So I ran the Jeff Nippard Powerbuilding Program(1.0) and finished it a little while ago, while debating on whether I should wait to run it again(I had two big three limiting injuries during the program) I've been self programming and tbh it feels quite good, better than running an actual program. Should I stick with this or is it better to leave the programming to professionals.",1

"Q: Is it bad to sleep 9+ hours ? When i wake up to work, im setting alarm and i sleep around 7-8 hrs. But when i have free weekend, i just set my alarm off and just sleep until i wake up, but sometimes its like 10-11 hrs. Even tho it looks like too much sleep, i must say that i feel really energetic, not like zombie. So my question is, is it bad to sleep that much, if i dont set my alarm and just wake up when i wake up, or even on free days i should set my alarm to sleep maximum 9 hours ? Thanks",1
Keto Crack Slaw - is it better to eat it before or after a workout?,1
"Recently found the ""add cabbage slaw to everything"" recipes that are supposed to burn more calories digesting than normal.  Since it can be cheap and tasty, I am adding it to my diet on workout days. So, hit me with how dumb it is and then with what's better before or after?",1
"Timing does not matter, unless the extra fiber gives you the farts, in which case I would suggest after.",1
I don't think you'll burn more calories. I do think the cabbage will make you feel fuller on fewer calories.,1
I too love cabbage. Great addition to a lot of different cuisines.,1

"If you ate an extra 1000 calories a day for an entire week pigging out during your vacation, you’d gain 2 pounds.  That’s two weeks of work of a cut at a 500 calorie deficit.  Point being, you aren’t going to undue an entire cut in one week.  Enjoy your vacation.",1
Every 3500 extra calories during your vacation increases the duration of your cut by a week.,1

The angle shouldn't really be changing during the squat.,1
Your knees and toes shouldn't be moving during a squat.  You might want to work on your hip mobility some more.,1
