"Good ab workouts that I can do in a very, very small room, I have some weights, so I can add weights to the exercise, I'm trying to be able to wear crop tops so I can show off my midriff, my stomach is quite round and soft in appearance, doesn't have much definition. Also any foods I should stay away from to reduce bloating as well.",1
Diet is key. Read the weight loss section of the wiki here.,1
How do any of you bring their chest towards the bar when doing pull ups?,1
"I've been doing chin ups, assisted pull ups, and negatives for about 2 months and I just can't manage to hit the bar with my chest or at least have the bar at level of my neck.",1
"The furthest I've got is raising myself until my forearms make an angle of about 45° from my shoulders, with my arms almost touching my sides. Going any further feels impossible for a human being, perhaps it is due to my back being pretty darn weak that it doesn't even squeeze in for that last part.",1
Any ideas?,1
Banded pullups to reduce the weight so you can work on increasing your ROM. Lat pull downs to your chest.,1
"I have a profound lateral pelvic tilt and I haven't been able to get rid of it, has anyone here successfully dealt with this issue and come out the other side.",1
"I have been workout great for about 1.5 years. Changed from big but boring to a normal 3 day split (upper lower and ab/mix). With my gym being -5 degrees c and just busy I’m getting worn out. What would be a good way to lower my exercises to continue but not push too much? I guess just maintain is fine. Should I just keep foundation exercises only(bench, squats, press etc)?",1
I'd check out the criteria for posting a routine critique in the sidebar. This isn't enough info to give you useful information. Personally I'd just do the PPL from the wiki.,1
I want to add an abdominal accessory to the GSLP routine. I read the book and he recommends adding:,1
“Direct Abdominal Exercises (Two Sets: 10-12 reps)”,1
My question: What are some examples of “direct abdominal exercises” I can use here?,1
I have an ab roller but I don’t know how to translate using it into reps. And basic sit-ups are too easy for me to only do 20-24…,1
Cable crunches are great here,1
You can hold weight to your chest to make situps harder.,1
"Im trying to do a lot of cardio for my endurance for basketball i do jumprope for 1hour and 60sec x 10 of wall sprints plus my plyometrics, does this affect my ability to build mass ? I dont have a lot of muscle im quite skinny",1
"No, just eat enough to make up for it",1
Does anyone have any resources on understanding cutting? Because I’m a little lost on that concept,1
"its pretty simple man.  between powering your organs and your exercise, your body burns a certain amount of calories every day.  thats called your TDEE.  if you deliberately consume less calories than that, your body will have no choice but to use your reserves for fuel.  google a TDEE calculator, subtract 500 from your result, build a diet that contains that many calories and approximately 1g of protein per lb of your lean bodyweight.  eat that diet for 6-8 weeks while maintaining your active lifestyle.  bam, you cut.",1
New dad with no long stretches of time during the day to workout. Is it ok to sprinkle workouts throughout the day?,1
Planning to do pushups during the morning (Maybe 3 max rep sets). Then pullups on the afternoon (Following the Armstrong training). I try to squeeze in some squats when I have time too.,1
Is it ok to do this? Or is it just way better if I can schedule a 30-45minute block devoted to working out?,1
bodyweight,1
"As a dad... if you have a newborn, get it in when you can. Between baby, momma, and work. Walk with the baby for naps, push ups, squats all of it! I would do KB swings with one kid napping in the stroller and the other drawing sidewalk chalk... It's hard!",1
"I am a 16-year-old male who weighs 107 pounds and stands 5'3 in height, and I would like to improve my bench press. I can bench 70 pounds for about ten to twelve reps, but I don't feel my chest even when using the correct form. Now I am doing dips to try to increase my bench. For my age, I feel really weak, but for my weight, I don't know whether I am weak or not.",1
"Increase weight to where you can barely do 5 reps, then work your way back up to 8-10 reps before increasing weight again.",1
Is it a good idea to workout evening and early morning? I'm just a teen beginner so am I doing it too much?,1
"I’d just follow a program and work out when it says to. If you’re talking about two a day workouts, you won’t benefit much from them.",1
"I am sick and tired of OHP. Its probably the best exercise I know of for overall strength building, but it really gets tiring after a while due to its incredibly unforgiving nature. I am looking for another shoulder builder, but my gym doesnt have any dumbells over 70lb, which is too light for me to switch to dumbell pressing. Any suggestions what to replace it with?",1
70 lbs still too light for Arnolds? GOAT delt builder imo,1
Single are Landmine shoulder presses are great.  All you need is a barbell and a corner.  That way you can load it with plates and won’t be restricted by dumbell weights (or getting them into position).,1
"Do behind the head neck press, push presses or BTN push presses for a bit then come back to OHP",1
"Shoulder press machine is great for hypertrophy but you’re not gonna get the same power that you would from ohp. I really wouldn’t ditch the OHP, it’s clearly working if 70 pound dumbell presses are light to you. I don’t like squatting at all but it’s just one of those things you really shouldn’t replace.",1
"This might be a silly question, but is there noticeable difference between having breakfast, waiting an hour or two, then going to the gym, or doing the reverse (Going to the gym first thing, then coming back and having breakfast)?",1
"For reference, I mean a light breakfast of like eggs on a bagel or oatmeal.",1
"It really depends on you. Some ppl like to workout fasted, while others need a meal or a snack before a workout.",1
I personally can’t function before breakfast. And I can’t function enough for a workout until I’ve had 2nd breakfast. Ymmv,1
"My arm looks narrow and weak when it's not contracted, but when I flex the arm to 90 degrees It looks wide including the biceps ball.",1
"This means that I have the small head of the biceps more developed than the rest of my arm muscles right? And that I should focus on the brachialis and brachioradialis, so hammer and prone curls instead of regular curls?",1
"I'm struggling to bulk, would it be smart to drink a bulking shake everyday? Not something extreme like 2000 cals but 500-1000 cals",1
Eat peanut butter sandwiches.,1
"Whatever floats your boat. If you struggle to gain weight, eat more calorie dense foods. Basically do the opposite of what you would want to do on a cut. Shakes can work. You can also make them yourself and they would probably be more healthy and nutritious than mass gainers, unless that's already what you were going to do.",1
"I used to use a website that collated and summarized all of the research on a variety of specific ingredients/minerals/vitamins (things like melatonin, vitamin d, etc and not specific supplements). It would then go down the line of benefit/risk and note them as being ""weakly supported"", ""strongly supported"", ""no evidence"", etc.",1
"It was a perfect compliment to labdoor.com as I could check if there was research that backed up a thing being useful, and then go to labdoor.com and check what supplements actually reliably provided the thing.",1
"It was like examine.com and consumerlab.com, but it's not either of those.",1
Any idea what site I'm talking about?,1
"Examine.com got a pretty big update some time ago, so maybe you remember examine.com but with a different design? No idea otherwise.",1
What’s everyone using for food tracking these days?  I just re-downloaded MFP and they are asking me to pay a subscription just to use the scanning tool.,1
"i like mymacros+.  i did have to buy it, buy it was a 1 time fee of $3 instead of a subscription like most other fitness apps ive seen.  works great, has been worth the money for me.",1
Macrofactor is really good. Not free but there's a 7 day trial if you want to give it a whirl.,1
MacroFactor is my favorite. I’ve used it since release and they keep making it better.,1
"If you are ok paying, macrofactor seems to be popular and often considered most useful. Cronometer was my favorite free one but i haven't used any in awhile.",1
Is there an exercise name for climbing up steps while in a low squat stance? The closest I can find is a “stair jump down squat” but this is just stepping up or down one leg at a time.,1
I think my biceps are very weak compared to the rest of my body.,1
"I’m 23, male, 145 lbs.",1
Bench: 205 Deadlift (hex): 305 Squat: 285,1
But I struggle to preacher curl 20 lb. dumbbells and can barely move 30’s at all without feeling like i’m gonna pull something.,1
This is low right? I work them out as often as everything else but don’t seem to be getting stronger.,1
Any advice would be sick,1
"Preacher curling is tough.  And with your numbers i don't think you're very far off in comparison.  Some of us just have to dedicate more time to smaller muscles groups, other guys never do isolation work and have great arms.  Good news is smaller muscles recovery faster, respond better to high reps and to going close to fatigue. If you want bigger biceps then work them out more",1
How has your bodyweight changed since you’ve been training? Have your biceps grown on your current program?,1
"I'm looking to build muscle and strength, but I enjoy ""fun"" exercises like animal walks, jumping up to a high platform, balancing on a wiggly prop, handstands, etc. Do you have any ideas for more fun exercises?",1
"Rock Climbing is a great full body workout that might be a good fit. Though unless you are near natural formations, the gyms can be pricey.",1
Calisthenics is also an option that has a lot of interesting body movements. Its mostly body weight activities so there is very little cost as well.,1
"Boxing gym / non sparring workout (heavy bag, jump rope, mitts, agility ladders, agility stuff). Free trials or drop in rate is a good start",1
"Maybe try out ""Calisthenics"", mostly bodyweight and you can learn cool movements.",1
I usually rock PHUL and have been super consistent for the past 8ish months. This week I have shit to do but I will have time to do my first U/L hypertrophy split but wont have time for the power U/L split so does anyone have a suggestion for a good one off full body workout that I can run just to get some work in instead of neglecting either my upper or lower body? (My week will look something like this U/L/R/F/R/R/R [Those last two aren't really rests I will just be skiing]),1
Run one of the days from 531 Building the Monolith,1
"Do a vertical pull, horizontal pull, horizontal push, a squat pattern and a hinge pattern. Choose whatever exercises you like and sprinkle in some fun stuff if you have time left over.",1
"If I do specific workout for triceps every day for like 15 minutes, will it affect my regular lifting performance which I do as part of crossfit program?",1
You can look up feeder workouts. I think John Meadows or Rich Piana used them and Jujimufu has a few YouTube video explaining them. It sounds like that’s what you want to do.,1
Depends how fatiguing the 15 minute workout is and how well you recover from it,1
"Probably, rest days are important not over train and let the muscles grow",1
"For a few months now my stools have been hard and there are times when I feel poop but it just won’t come out, and I sometimes have smelly farts later due to it decomposing inside.",1
"I am fairly sure this is due to my protein intake, I have tried managing it and cutting my protein powder consumption in half. I consume fiber from vegetables and fruits every day, so I’m not sure what the problem is. Any tips?",1
"Couple magnesium tablets a day plus more fibre did trick for me. I put tbsp of chia seed in water bottle, leave for hour then sip on it.",1
More water and consider a fiber supplement (containing both soluble and insoluble).  I experienced this and found a supplement helped.  Try to get around ~40g a day.,1
"Split squats, leg raised or on the ground? What's the difference between the two and does it matter so much?",1
"I've deen doing sets of them recently with my rear leg on the ground, more of a stationary Lunge, and have seen videos where the rear leg is raised. Should I be doing them this way instead?",1
"I personally recommend back foot on the ground, which for me stretches the hip flexor of the back leg, which is developing hip mobility. Plus, for me, it's harder to balance this way, which means I should do it this way.",1
It doesn't make a huge difference. You might find it easier to increase range of motion with a raised leg but you may also find it harder to load up due to balance.,1
Are 15 set workouts okay? Ive had less time these days for a full 20. Scared of regression,1
Depends on your current goal.,1
"I do 6 exercises x 3 sets each for 18 sets per workout. The first two exercises are the primary ones of the day, then the next two are to fill out the day's work, then the final two are my accessory stuff that don't wear me out. The first 4 exercises are the staples though, so once I finish the 4th exercise, I know I can finish the final two exercises and six sets in 15-ish minutes.",1
"Mind you, I still take over an hour working out. I walk on the treadmill and do dynamic mobility work for the first 15 minutes, then the 18 sets take 60-80 minutes simply because I tend to rest 3 minutes instead of 2 in between sets. Tbh, I don't know how people can rest for less than 3 minutes when going hard on things like front squats, RDLs, BB rows, etc. Then again, I go Reps in Reserve (RIR) and always stay in the 1-3 RIR range, and 3 sets of that is more than enough for me.",1
"If those 15 sets are appropriately difficult, yes. Just cutting 5 sets from your workout and keeping intensity the same is not a good idea.",1
"As someone said you need very little to maintain, around 1/9th of the volume you usually do is enough to maintain your muscle mass (rule of thumb, it varies from person to person).",1
"15 sets are more than fine, if you are limited on time and have to lower sets you can incoorporate more compound exercises and less isolations to make up for it.",1
"They are okay. You need to do very little to maintain your level. If you reduce your workload you might even progress better, or maybe a bit slower. We don't know.",1
"My reps count drops significantly over sets. For example, I did 15lbs dumbbell bicep curls doing 11/8/5 reps to failure (i.e. I strained so hard on the 12/9/6th rep and I cant lift it more than half way through). Is that normal and is that bad?",1
"That is supposed to happen, the muscle gets tired when working so naturally the number of reps drop, you should be concerned if it went the other way.",1
Some muscle groups are different though. In my experience bicep has the biggest drop and back or chest has the least drop in reps during sets.,1
edit: Your rest also plays into this. If you're resting for 1 minute then you're gonna drop even more reps cause your muscles haven't recovered properly yet.,1
"Seems pretty typical. It's not bad, if you want to have more even sets stay a few reps from failure.",1
I always aim for even sets. I would drop the weight to where you can do the same number of reps in each set personally,1
What is the ideal amount of sets and exercises per muscle group? And how many times a week I should work on it ? Currently on a bro Split. For example when I do Chest I do Bench 3x8 max weight I can rep. Then incline dumbbell Press 3x8 and then Chest flies 3x8 again. And it just feels like it's not enough? I'm doing warm-ups with lighter weight for every exercise,1
"Google MEV and MRV, it will probably answer your question.",1
"There is no ideal amount of sets per muscle group. It ranges from around 10-20 sets per week. Some may need more, some may need less. Depends on the individual, experience level, intensity of those sets, etc.",1
"Stop doing fixed reps and do sets to certain proximity to failure. If you can do your last set with 8 reps, it means your first set was a warmup and you probably could've done 12.",1
"I have my cold plunge set up ready to go, HOWEVER before I do this. I would like to know...",1
What is your routine to warm back up? I used to hop in the sauna but that is no longer an option.,1
,1
Curious on your thoughts?,1
Just dry off and go in doors,1
'Completing' proteins,1
"I have been using lentils a lot recently as I'm broke and they are plant-based. Problem is, they do not have 'complete' proteins. I read that serving them with rice 'completes' them, but how does the math work behind it?",1
"If I have 20g of protein in the lentils, does that mean I need 20g worth of protein in the rice for full complementation?",1
Is there any easy way to make lentils a complete protein?,1
"If you eat even a slightly varied vegetarian diet, you will be getting complete protein - different plants have different different amino acids, so you will get some of everything, which is what complete means here. Still, it is possible that you're not getting optimal amounts of each of them, but that analysis is way more complex than 20g lentils = 20g rice.",1
"Some, like leucine, have thresholds - you need them, but at some stage the benefit stops, at around 2-3g leucine per meal . Meat has more leucine than plants, but plants still have it. Cooked lentils have 0.65g/100g, so getting optimal leucine from lentils would require a whole bunch of them. But oats have 1.28g/100g, nuts have a bunch, rice has some (0.2g/100g).. If you want to optimize leucine, you need to set up a spreadsheet and calculate your getting a good amount in total. It is very important to include all sources in these calculations, as we can't ignore the 0.2g here and 0.3 there, when the goal is just 3g at the upper limit.",1
"And you'd need to repeat this for each of the 9 essential amino acids, or at least the 3 BCAAs.",1
"If you eat a varied vegetarian diet, where you vary the bean/legume (sometimes lentils, sometimes chickpeas) and the other parts of a meal (oats, rice), and eat some dairy too, it is pretty likely that doing this analysis would conclude you're not lacking in any of the them. It's a pretty substantial analysis to do, so you'll have to decide if it's worth it for you.",1
Is there any easy way to make lentils a complete protein?,1
You can't change an incomplete amino acid profile into a complete one on its own; you need to supplement it with something.,1
"As the other guy points out, rice would be a good addition to get all EAA's.",1
Lentils do not have all essential amino acids.  Rice does.  If all of your protein came from lentils alone your body would still be deficient in cysteine and methionine.,1
"Why can I only do 15 pushups at a time, despite working out and eating right?",1
"Is that 15 at a time for 3 sets, so 45 in total? Cos thats good for the time you've been working out. If not, break it down into sets and take a rest between, you're overall numbers will be higher.",1
"If you're already doing sets, maybe it's time to add some weight or other assistance exercises?",1
"I'm a woman and have been working out for more like 2 years now. Gun to my head, I could probably do 25-30 in one go if I'm fresh. 20 is about the max I ever do at one time",1
"Everybody is different, we all train differently and respond to training differently. If you keep training hard, with some degree of intelligence, you will make progress. Don’t focus on others focus on beating yourself.",1
Should/can I do assisted pullups instead of lat pulldowns if I like doing assisted pullups more?,1
You can do,1
"I guess you want to know if these will train your lats as well. There are also close neutral grip pullups which might be better for lats than lat pulldowns, google those if you're interested.",1
If you want to get better at pullups then yes,1
"To anyone who ran 5 days UL/PPL hybrid approach, in what order did you find it to be the best? in terms for avoiding overlapping fatigue, etcetc,",1
Upper,1
Lower,1
Rest,1
Push,1
Pull,1
Legs,1
Rest,1
That way every muscle group gets at least 2 days rest. You can also do it the other way around PPl before UL.,1
"It doesn't really matter, the program is more important than the split. A well written program will already take fatigue into account. What are you following at the moment?",1
"Just run a proper program. Fatigue can be managed in a vast number of ways. There are many people who do heavy lower body compound lifts 5-6 days a week, without issue. So a just run a proven program.",1
"So i know that in order to get max gains you need to aim for hypertrophy, and the best way to do that is go to failure or close to failure on most sets. But when it comes to my calves, i can literally do calf raises nonstop for probably a few hundred reps, and i dont want to have to do that but i want to maximize my gains. How do i increase the intensity so im only having to do 15-30 reps per set?",1
Weight,1
"Add weight. Seated with a barbell or standing with a dumbbell, standing with a smith machine etc.",1
Total body workout vs PPL. Any preferences?,1
"If it’s 3 days a week, probably full body. If it’s 6 days a week, probably PPL.",1
Which ever one you think you'd be more consistent at,1
I'm having trouble with meeting my caloric needs each day,1
Maybe I'm overthinking things but I calculated my daily caloric needs after a 400 cal deficit and it's around 1800 a day. I've been counting the calories of everything I've been eating and I'm trying to also keep lean with the foods I eat and I find myself ending up at around 1200 max a day. I'm probably over thinking what to eat and all but I'm having a lot of trouble thinking of what to eat to get my calories in while also eating right. Any tips or meals that would help?,1
I wouldn't only eat lean foods.. fat is an essential part of our diet. We need fat. And I have eaten fatty cuts like a ribeye steak or salmon while on a cut and lost weight.,1
"The better (imo) approach is to avoid ultra processed foods for majority of your diet. This boils down to only eating meat, veggies, fruit and grain. Dairy (butter, cheese, etc) are minimally processed, so I usually add that in as well. What I limit or remove entirely from my diet: bread, pasta, chips, cereal, sweets of any kind, etc. Basically, if it comes ready to eat in a box/bag. While losing weight, I cut these out entirely. When I'm not, I'll have a few treats here and there. But these are not daily foods for me.",1
"You dont have to only eat lean, because you can have a healthy diet where ~80% of it is organic/lean/lowfat or what have you and ~20% you can allow for higher calorie/processed food while still maintaining great health. Id say dont be so strict on yourself and let yourself eat higher calorie foods and it will be much easier to reach your caloric needs.",1
Edit: make sure you are accounting for things like oil (olive oil is very high in calories) and butter and mayonnaise and stuff like that. You may actually be getting a lot more calories than you think.,1
I feel like my biceps aren't getting stronger,1
"I've been working out for years and that feeling for lifting more and more weight is amazing, I love it. But for the longest time I didn't really work out my biceps much but a few months ago I decided to go for it. I've been doing 3 sets of 10 with the ez curl bar and 3 sets of 10 with hammer curls. I've been training hard and consistently but I swear I'm not getting any stronger. I've been doing 60 pounds on the ez bar for weeks now and I just can't do any more. At the same time I'm still doing bench and other work outs and I'm still getting stronger in the those areas but not with my biceps. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong. Any advice?",1
Are you reaching failure?,1
Try some different exercises. I might focus on DBs. Maybe traditional DB curls and/or concentration curls as a start. Try varying the rep range some too. Maybe do some lighter weight higher rep workouts then next time lower rep high weight. Mix it up.,1
Isolation movements always progress much more slowly than compounds. You may not be doing anything wrong.,1
"Hey, so for the next month and a half I have the option of training twice a day. I'm going to be working 14+hrs per day. My team at work have agreed that they'll go to the work gym for an hour in the evenings to break up the workday. Now I don't trust them one bit to do this. So I don't want to depend on them to actually go to the gym.",1
"I was thinking, I go to the gym in the morning do my T1's and T2's then do T3's and back with the work guys in the evenings. Does this sound good? That was an the very least my big lifts are hit early and keep progressing.",1
That’s fine,1
"like once every six months while doing dumbbell shoulder press my left shoulder feels like it slips back, theres a lot of cracking and pain, then I have to ice it for like a week. What is that and how do I avoid it?",1
"go to a doctor, dont take medical advice from an online forum.",1
does anyone follow CarnivoreMD? now you’re not supposed to eat spinach or leafy greens on nightshades or even spices like black pepper or ginger? also no chicken fish or pork?,1
"Paul Saladino is a psychiatrist who works at a fucking dentist’s office. He has no special nutrition training beyond what’s given in pre-med and medical school and his advice is not in line with the overwhelming majority of doctors’ recommendations, especially those who research and treat nutritional issues. Carnivore is a weird fad diet, not a generalizable or useful recommendation for how just about anyone should eat.",1
Any good resources for starting a cut after a long bulk? Been bulking for about 8 months now and definitely have a good amount of fat I’d like to get rid of without sacrificing much (or any ideally) strength or muscle mass. I’ve looked through the wiki and can’t find anything specifying how to correctly go about cutting.,1
How much stronger did you get?,1
There’s very definitely a section about fat loss,1
"Think about the situation. For example, if it's a muscle I really want to focus on but there's a second exercise planned for it during the same workout then do 1 or 0 drop set. You still want to be able to complete your other exercises. If it's the last exercise of the day then you can do as many as you want but I doubt there's much added benefit after the 2nd one and it's mostly just for fun.",1
"Depends on the purpose of the drop set in the program, there are a wide variety of correct answers depending on the situation",1
However many times your programme tells you to.,1
"Hello! As someone who is sedintary with bad posture, is there a good stretch / warm up routine I can to do when I go to the gym?",1
"YMMV but I do like some static stretching before lifting. For leg stuff, some foam rolling to loosen up too.",1
"Mainly though, if you’re new to lifting, do less volume and weight than you’re capable of and ramp up slowly each workout. If you jump in and do your max you’ll at best be insanely sore and at worst injure something and be sidelined. Give your body time to adjust to weightlifting and the range of motion involved before going balls to the wall 🙃",1
"Somewhat heterodox opinion, but so long as you're doing warm-up sets to each exercise (especially for the compound lifts you're likely starting a session with) and you're lifting with a full range of motion then it's somewhat unnecessary.",1
Most of my mobility work is done as active recovery to specifically get some fresh blood into an aching muscle or joint.,1
What are some pros and cons of replacing deadlifts almost entirely with RDLs?,1
"Pros: Less fatigue, more direct simulus to the posterior chain, eccentric which is the most important part of the rep for hypertrophy Cons: Won't be as useful for increasing deadlift strength. Slightly less stimulus on spinal erectors and traps.",1
"Basically RDLs are the superior option for hypertrophy, but both are great.",1
"Well you aren't going to be able to load an RDL as heavy as a deadlift, so you're missing out on some stimulus there. But RDLs are easier to do for high reps, and still hit all the major muscle groups you'll want to hit.",1
Pros: potentially a better stimulus to fatigue ratio for similar levels of hamstring development,1
"Cons: lower weights and greater focus on hamstrings may mean less benefits to developing your back, grip, etc",1
Arent they the complete different exercises? One for back one for hamstring.,1
I think Bench Press is too demanding for a superset but give it a try.,1
Yes.,1
Is there a webpage out there which will allow me to plan meals for the week/month?,1
What I want is a total of calories/nutrients for each day based on the meals I have planned - with the option to mix/match the selections to make sure each day I am getting enough nutrients & the right amount of calories.,1
Pretty sure eatthismuch.com has this feature(possibly paid).,1
Use Cronometer and just input things ahead of time. I think premium has a feature to copy/paste meals/days,1
"This is probably a dumb question, but I’m still relatively new.",1
"When people write in programs and such “do 3x12” or “3x8” for certain exercises, does that really matter? Why is it so specific? Shouldn’t I just be doing my reps until failure anyway until I can reach 10-12, and then upping the weight (aka, following progressive overload) ?",1
"I hope that makes sense. Basically, I’ve been doing 3x6-8 on most of my lifts, until I can reach 10-12, then I up the weight. Is that okay?",1
"I'd say you are right. I like reaching failure as it also helps me know if I might be using to little weight. There are exercises I can't bear to do 12 reps of (too mentally challenging) so that might be a reason to recommend 8 instead. For some exercises it's just science that backs up better results at heavier weights with lower reps, etc.",1
"So, in general those reps are more of a goal. If you don't reach it then you try again the same reps next time. The actual number of reps recommended is based on: science, safety of the exercise, and psychological stress.",1
A lot of people exclusively run double progression (what you are describing) close to or at failure for their isolations. You can't really do this with compounds though,1
"Going to failure on every set builds excessive and unnecessary fatigue, obviously it has a place and u should go to failure but not all the time",1
"Yes, it does matter.",1
You can read more about rep ranges here: https://www.strongerbyscience.com/hypertrophy-range-fact-fiction/,1
"What you are doing is okay, but I'd recommend checking out the recommend routines in the wiki.",1
Rep ranges are important in the sense that if you go from 3x8-3x12 at the same weight then you got noticeably stronger.,1
"Sticking to them matters, but what they actually are doesn’t matter as much.",1
Yes you should progressively overload by choosing a rep range that fits you.,1
Some programs have a set number of reps because unleashing progressive overload on someone who is completely new can be quite a lot.,1
So when a beginner sees 3x8 for example they do 8 of that exercise and then they increase the weight and then you get some kind of progressive overload. With beginner gains and everything it can take some time before they actually get stuck and need to progressively overload in a rep range rather than a set amount of reps.,1
I'm a beginner at a cut. I am 5 9 and weigh 180 lbs. How much protein do I need to eat to increase muscle mass and strength while also cutting fat? Is 180 lbs a day sufficient?,1
https://youtu.be/SLGEDf9Ugi0,1
"180 is plenty.  If you're cutting, you can do your goal weight as the benchmark, with 1g/lb as the conversion.",1
0.8-1g per lb. The diet section of the wiki is a great resource,1
"(I am not asking for actual medical advice, just wondering if anyone knows of any correlations between or studies covering the things I am asking about)",1
"Over the past 3-4 weeks I’m finding that when lifting, particularly on leg days, my heart rate has been getting pretty high, bouncing around between 80-90% of my max heart rate (assuming 220-age) according to my watch. I have to take longer between sets to stop feeling woozy / shitty. I have been lifting for a few years and have not changed my programming lately. I am on a cut so I haven’t even been increasing weight or reps.",1
"Could this heart rate increase be related to cutting, or is it simply a sign that my cardiovascular fitness has declined?",1
At what point is elevated heart rate while lifting a cause for concern? What is considered normal?,1
"I have been thinking about getting a lifting belt. Would using a belt potentially exacerbate this heart rate situation? I’ve read that belts can be a bad choice for those with high blood pressure, which I don’t think I have, but I don’t want to make things worse.",1
"220-age is not a formula for maximum heart rate. Using that is like using 220lbs-age as a formula for your weight. Both heart rate and body weight vary a lot between individuals, much more so than any correlation on age.",1
"That much said, lifting heavy stresses your body in multiple different ways: the prime movers of the exercise, stabilizer muscles, cardiovascular stress, overall metabolic stress, and mental stress. A high heart rate and feeling woozy/shitty indicate that cardiovascular stress is a limiting factors on your sets. Consider doing a small amount of low intensity cardio exercise, such as 3x30 minutes per week, to gradually improve cardiovascular fitness.",1
"If you're concerned about blood pressure, just get yourself one of those devices to measure blood pressure, they are cheap. Naturally, blood pressure will be high when lifting very heavy. Rather, you want to check whether your blood pressure is high before a workout, or several hours after working out.",1
"When I squat heavy (2.2x bw+)I feel my heart beating very hard and feel faint and dizzy, not like I’m unhealthy or anything as I’m 5’8 150 lbs and have never had heart problems or even conditioning problems when I played soccer at a decently high level",1
220 - age is not remotely accurate.,1
"I have seriously strong leg muscles but my lungs just can’t keep up with the running. Any tips of solving this? I don’t smoke cigarettes, don’t drink, i do smoke marijuana but i plan to quit. Less than a year ago I could run nearly 4 miles on ease. My legs can still do it but lungs can’t i’m absolutely confused. I did stop running but I’ve ran on and off throughout the year. Now i’m motivated and ready to get fit and healthy again so any tips here would great and sorry for the paragraph",1
Quit smokIng pot.,1
Run slower.,1
did you get covid?,1
"otherwise, youre just out of shape and need to get back in the groove of running again",1
"Keep running and it will get better over time. Start with longer, slower runs to build a cardiovascular base, then Amp up into shorter faster sessions.",1
Try something like couch to 5k to get back in the swing of things and build your cardio back up. It's linked in the wiki. r/running is also a great resource.,1
hello,1
"i have had this small preoccupation for a while: is joint popping actually a bad sign during exercise? i am under the impression that it is not concerning if it happens here and there, but i feel (and sometimes hear) a few small pops each time i repeat certain movements - for example rotating my knuckles, any movement on my ankles, the shoulder blades when rotating the shoulders, and a few more. i fear that this popping frequency can actually become an issue. am i worrying too much?",1
"I think the rule of thumb with popping is if it is just popping with no accompanying pain, then it isn't something to worry about.",1
My bench press has been stuck at 195lbs for like 2 months and everything I try won’t work. Tried adding more volume and I’ve tried doing bench press alternations. I’m 6 foot 4 and around 220 lbs. Tips on what I can do to break a plateau?,1
You need to be consistently be in a caloric surplus to gain strength long term,1
"Why do you fail your bench? Is it you can’t get it off your chest, sticking point, can’t lock out, I’ve never had a problem off my chest but for sticking point I did double pause for low reps and lockout I did more specific tricep work",1
"You can try deload and see if that helps, maybe you're not recovering enough.",1
"Also if you're stuck on a beginner program, you could move to a more intermediate program which adds more isolation work for your triceps.",1
As someone said gaining mass will help. There are exercises that can help increase your bench.,1
"You can do a static hold. That is when you load way more than you can bench, maybe 225 for you and you unrack it, and then you just hold it for 10 seconds. Then 200 will feel quite light.",1
"There is another exercise i don't remember the name of, but basically you put on safety bars and then you take the barbell under it, with no weight on, and you just push against the safety bars with all you got for 5-10 seconds. This will help the last part of the lift.",1
"If your problem is off the chest you can work on some technique. You don't wanna push straight up from the chest, but rather push it slightly towards your head before pressing. Also keep straight wrists and you know basic things.",1
"Else try googling ""help increase bench press off the chest"" and you might find some more.",1
Gaining bodyweight will go a LONG way,1
if anyone is curious i am eating around 1.5k-2k calories a day and burning 3-4k.,1
"That's too big of a deficit, except if you're currently quite obese. Which you aren't.",1
I dub thee Icarus,1
How has your weight loss been going? I find it hard to believe you're burning 3000 calories a day. The math doesn't add up with you eating 2k a day and burning up to 4k. You should be losing like 4lbs a week at that rate.,1
Check out the sidebar for how to post a routine critique. Yours doesn't offer enough info to give you much help. I'd look into the routines in the wiki.,1
"Hey, question on mulvitiamins -> are they worth it as a supplement for active person that do strenght training ? I have pretty clean diet, but i dont track ,icronutrients, i just eat differently everyday and i dont supplement any vitamins/minerals. I mean in my country, i looked and even quality reccomended multivitamins are for good price, so i can use it as ""just to be sure"", but do they dont even work ? Idk, what is your opinion on (im talking about qiality ones) multivitamins for active people ? Ty",1
"Totally depends on your diet.  Most people do not have any benefit.  I like taking a multivitamin on a cut since i feel like i might be lacking a few nutrients, i figure it can't hurt.",1
"Tried squatting for the first time today, and felt a weird tingling in my arm followed by a bit of a cramp. Reddit says I pinched/compressed a nerve.",1
"I think I’m gonna stick to deadlifts and benching , the feeling kind of spooked me",1
"barbell squatting for the first time will put your arms and back in a position it probably hasn't been in before, so it's typical for you to feel some discomfort initially. Just take it slow with just the bar or with light weight if you want to try again. Also explore different grip widths on the bar to see what feels best.",1
I usually warm up my shoulders before squats,1
I would recommend using a band or a wooden pole to stretch out your arms and upper back prior to squating. The arm position on squat (especially with low-bar) requires a decent amount of mobility and I 100% need to stretch to do it comfortably.,1
I definitely wouldn’t omit something as important as squating from your program if that’s the only symptom you’ve had.,1
"Sometimes I get an arm cramp squatting, usually just widening my grip fixes it",1
Squats aren't dangerous but I would work on your mobility.,1
"I’m pretty overweight and I’m starting to goto the gym I’ve been dieting since late September I read a lot online about having to eat 0.8 grams of protein per lb of body weight to be able to build muscle, would this still apply to someone around 300lbs like me? I don’t think I can .8g of protein per lb of body weight.",1
"Use your ideal weight, not your current if you have a lot of extra weight to lose.",1
For overweight lifters I think a pretty good estimate is to just use your height in cm as your protein goal. 1g protein per cm in height.,1
It's fine if you base your protein target on your goal weight. That will be achievable while also being effective.,1
In that case I'd stick to 0.8g per lbs of lean mass.,1
Most people would tell you to focus on the caloric targets vs. hitting macros if you are at that point and focusing on weight loss.,1
Do I have to gain belly fat in order to bulk? Last time I bulked my stomach was disproportionately huge.,1
Yes,1
https://www.elitefts.com/education/novice/how-to-stay-small-and-weak/,1
"You don't have to, but it would be a common side effect of bulking.",1
The more calorie surplus you're in the more belly fat you will gain.,1
"You can bulk on 300-500 calories surplus, and that should limit how quick you gain belly fat (and fat everywhere else for that matter).",1
"You don't have to ""get fat"" during a bulk if that makes sense, but you will gain some fat. That's why cutting exists.",1
How important is weight lifting for losing weight? I’m currently only walking 2.5 hours a week on a treadmill at 3 mph and 3% incline. Weight ain’t coming off at all.,1
"As others said weight loss is mostly diet, but exercise CAN help. All things equal, if you aren’t gaining weight, and add exercise, you should start to lose some IF you’re eating the same.",1
"So, that’s something to check. Some people end up eating more after working out and more than offset their workout as a result.",1
"All that said I think walking is great, but if you’re at all inclined I do recommend strength training of some kind in addition for overall fitness and health.",1
Weight loss happens in the kitchen. Calories in < calories out.,1
"Walking 7.5 miles per week is an insufficient amount of exercise to make any noticeable difference on your weight. It will help your cardiovascular fitness, but will not help with losing weight.",1
"Weight lifting is unlikely to help with the weight loss. Like walking, weight lifting burns only a relatively small amount of calories per hour, especially for untrained athletes. Consistently lifting weights can lead to increased muscle mass, and thus to less body fat at the same weight. That is healthy, but it is not a quick fix for a bad diet, and if you keep eating to much, you might still gain body fat despite lifting weights.",1
"How come guys that do running sports such as soccer and rugby have such big legs? I thought just doing cardio would mean they'd be slim. And most i know don't do gym, just play running sports all week.",1
Would I be able to combine treadmill with gym exercises (squats/ deadlift) to get big legs? Thanks,1
Genetics and they do resistance training.,1
"Rugby does a lot of start/stop sprinting which builds powerful legs and helps hypertrophy. In comparison, distance runners like marathoners often have very slender legs. Rugby players also train legs a lot to improve their tackling power.",1
"Having big legs is an advantage to the sport. If you are good at a sport you're more likely to stick to it than if you werent. (Similarly to how people that stick to the gym are likely to have better genetics than average, they stick to it 'cause they're good at it) You can combine treadmill with the gym but your legs arent gonna grow from it.",1
"Do I need to eat enough protein on days I work out, or simply everyday? What if you dont eat enough protein on days you dont workout?",1
Your body is still recovering and growing/maintaining muscle on days you don't work out. Get your protein goals in every day,1
"Everyday, if you don't eat enough protein your muscle growth will be sub-optimal.",1
"Every day. Your muscles don't just grow and stop the day you work out, they need the protein for days after.",1
Everyday,1
"For those on 531, how often do you find yourself having to recalculate your tm after your anchor cycle when you do the tm test week before starting your next block of cycles ?",1
"I always base my tm test on my 1+ pr set.  I never go higher than the  5/10 lb increase but if I only get, say, 4 reps at 200 lbs OB might pr set, I might do a tm test at 195.",1
Thanks for the reply. About how often do you have to recalculate your tm after your 1+ set on the anchor before starting your next leaders ?,1
Depends on the lift. OHP more than deadlift. To be honest it doesn't really matter. The tm is a tool to make sure your training at the appropriate weights for your next leader/leader/anchor cycle. Focus on your pr sets and setting prs on those.,1
I'm on my 7th cycle right now.,1
I'll probably go to 8 and then retest 1RM. Or maybe make the push to 10th cycle.,1
I'm just noticing CNS fatigue hits a little bit harder now. I liked it when I didn't really feel as fatigued (like the first 4 cycles).,1
"Are you using the newer methods like the leader/ anchors, or the older versions of 531 ?",1
5 forward 3 back.,1
Whatever that is.,1
I live in a ski town and usually in January-March I avoid the new years crowds and skip the gym. I get out into the mountains for snowboarding/ski touring a few times a week and that suits me fine for physical activity.,1
"I lifted pretty intensely this autumn/early winter and don't want to lose/pause my gains, so I think I'm gong to keep going once/week through the snow season.",1
If I can squeeze a 1-1.5 hour session in before work early in the week what kind of plan should I be pursuing?,1
"If I were hoping to go one day per week, I would do something like this.",1
"Four main exercises: high bar squat, bench, Romanian deadlift, pullup.",1
I would probably do 4 or 5 sets each.,1
"I opt for RDL instead of conventional because it would already be hard to get through so many big exercises, and the systemic fatigue of RDL is lower because the weights are lighter.",1
"Then I would choose two to three supplemental lifts. My choices would probably be Arnold press, and a horizontal row like cable row ( I wouldn't do barbell row because squat and RDL would already wear out my lower back). If you want a bicep, tricep, side delt, or quad isolation you could also add it, but I would try to add too much. With one day per week you can't fit in too much isolation work.",1
I would also say switching up the supplemental work for similar movements every few weeks is probably a good idea.,1
"I’d do 531, two main lifts per day.  It would look a lot like 531 for Beginners, but dropping the third day.  Day 1 done the first week, Day 2 the following week.  Assistance work would be variations of the lifts not done that week.",1

Hiii I’m a female and I’m pretty low weight (like bmi 17) and I try to avoid traps exercises but they’re still big? Like my traps have been big even before I started working out. I’m also not super muscular so it’s weird. Are there are habits that cause this? Like slouching or sleeping weirdly?,1
"The most likely case isn’t that your traps are big, it’s that they are pronounced as a result of your thinness.",1
If your BMI is 17 your traps are not big. Nothing about you is big. That is significantly underweight.,1
"If you have a BMI of 17, nothing is big. You need to eat.",1
What accessory would help me break off the floor for deadlifts?,1
"Rep 2, 3 and beyond are fine but that first rep off the floor always has my legs shaking all over the place.",1
Deficit deadlifts,1
"For me it was snatch grip deadift, and/or deficit deadlift. Uses the quads more, which helped me a lot with floor pulls",1
"Effective back exercises that are easy to perform properly? Already do pull ups, lat pull but I think the seated row is causing some sternum, chest, back discomfort the next day due to my form. While I try to improve my form are there any other back exercises I should be doing?",1
"Single arm DB row, single arm standing cable row, kneeling single arm cable pull down",1
I've started doing supersets of standing cable lat pulldowns and seated rows in order to be more efficient. I do it in this schedule:,1
Lat pulldowns -> 1 min break -> seated rows -> 1 min break,1
And then repeat.,1
"Is this a bad idea since they both target the back, or am I good to go?",1
"Supersetting two movements that target the same muscle group doesn’t really have many advantages. Each superset is effectively going to function as one hard set of lat work, not two separate ones.",1
"Why isn't pork as popular in the fitness community as beef, chicken, and salmon?",1
"Like other meats such as lamb or goat, I understand because they themselves are not as common in America. But obviously pork is widely eaten here. So is there room for lean cuts of pork in the diet of the fitness community? I usually also just eat beef, chicken, and salmon, but I'll be staying at a Hindu family for about a month. They don't eat beef and so obviously I am not going to cook beef in their home. I dropped by the groceries but couldn't find any lamb cuts, so I figured why not pork? They have the 25g of protein.. pretty much the same amount of fat as beef. I think they only outlier I saw was that the cholesterol level was quite high. I like variety in my diet so I didn't want to eat just chicken and salmon.",1
"My best guess is that it’s because pork is harder for most people to cook. It has a reputation for being “more dangerous” to eat undercooked than beef, and the margin for error when cooking cuts of pork that are as lean as chicken breast is way smaller. Overcook a chicken breast a few degrees and it’s a bit dry but edible. Overcook a pork chop a little and it’s shoe leather.",1
"Obviously the solution is to just buy an instant read meat thermometer, but in my experience most of the fitness community is pretty appalling in the kitchen so that’s a lot to ask.",1
Meat thermometer. Changed my life.,1
"Yup, bought the MEATER thermometer and it’s perfectly cooked meat every fucking time. It made me realize how easy it is to under or overcook.",1
"Same, I’ll never go back to not using one.",1
"People are just weird about pork for some reason. It’s also fairly bland. I love pork, but I’m from Iowa and I feel like pork is the main meat here",1
Worried I’m in an online echo chamber for tall people squatting?,1
"Hello! I have been working working out consistently for about 4 months now however have been in the gym at some point or another for 3 or so years. I have recently begun to take squatting very seriously however have found that it is extremely difficult for me (most leg exercises i have no problem with at all, only my squat.) I believe this is due to me being tall (6,3) and looked up whether being tall could effect how I should squat. What I found is that it should, to the point that perhaps different exercises would be better at build my leg strength. HOWEVER, I fear the internet is just telling me what I want to hear. I would like to hear from you all what my best course of action is.",1
(This video shows the exercise I would consider changing to),1
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YTbJ9FR-gYs,1
"Split squats are great. But if you want to get good at doing loaded back squats, you really need to do loaded back squats fairly regularly. There is a skill element involved. Personally, I believe high rep squats are the single best movement for adding lean mass. Having said that, no particular movement is required. Lots of big, strong people never squat.",1
I’m 6’2” and always struggled with squat with my long legs. Breaking parallel was a big issue. I just made it a focus and started squatting 3x a week to really grow it. Great results and slowly becoming one of my fav lifts.,1
It's not so much your height that matters - it's your torso to leg ratio. More specifically your torso to femur ratio.,1
"That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't squat, it just means that your biomechanics are going to be different than someone with a long torso/short legs.  Things like elevating your heals, widening your stance, etc. I recommend googling squatting with long femurs for some tips, if this applies to you.",1
What is difficult about the lift for you?,1
"I'm also fairly tall (6'1) and was struggling with squats, the key for me was improving my hip mobility in conjunction with getting a high heel lift lifting shoe to compensate for poor ankle mobility (a lot harder to improve). I can now squat below parallel with good form after a few months of dedicated mobility work.",1
"Honestly, unlocking the squat is an incredible feeling and the day-to-day tasks that squatting makes easier like bending down, picking things up, etc. makes it very important even outside the gym to be able to squat. It's one of the most functional movements out there. So I highly encourage trying to improve your squat mobility.",1
Watch this when you get some time,1

Does anyone have a solution to when their gym shorts go up and reveal their underwear? Not a fan of sweats when working out,1
Compression sports underwear that’s meant to show,1
Get some shorts that have a liner,1
Didn’t know these existed thank you,1
I just let it be. No one’s looking. No one cares. If they are looking then they can look. But thats just me.,1
Is one arm landmine row a suitable replacement for face pulls on Reddit ppl?,1

"For those who sweat a lot from working out - what are your good deodorant suggestions? I had been trying out some of the more “natural” deodorants, but they don’t help much with odor after my post-workout showers.",1
"Hate to say it but ""natural"" deodorants suck at their intended purpose.",1
Are you not using soap when you shower?,1
"Of course, but I notice a big difference in how long my current “natural” deodorant is able to control odor. Especially with how often I workout, even after a good shower I can sense my own BO rather than a clean feeling.",1
"I personally find that waxy-ish natural deodorants end up making me smell worse. It’s hard to clean off both clothes and yourself, and I suspect it just traps bacteria leading to a musty smell. I switched back to a non-antiperspirant Degree deodorant and haven’t had any problems since.",1
"Do people yelling ""ONE MORE! NO, DO ANOTHER ONE! ANOTHER!!!"" actually help you?",1
"I can get behind the ""PUSH!!!"" mentality for one last rep but the first scenario kinda grinds my gears a bit.",1
Verbal encouragement can indeed be productive.  It tends to get the person stop thinking about the lift and just trying to try.  That is sometimes all it takes to knock out extra.,1
"My buddy was doing 350 with a goal of ten, he hit ten and me and other people started screaming ten more cuz it looked too easy. He did ten more. I don’t know if he would’ve been able to do that without the hype.

"I’ve been doing the beginner 3x5 for a little over 3 months now. Have loved the beginner gains, all going well. Haven’t gained or lost any weight but definitely am stronger and have noticed some minor changes in my body.",1
"The next step for me would be to find a more long term program, but what if my goals are just general health? Seems most programs are built for building major size, and I just don’t have the desire to force feed myself every day to bulk up to actually see something serious with these programs. To be frank, aesthetics are really not important to me at all. Obviously that doesn’t mean I’m ok with looking like shit, yes I have a lean build but I don’t look bad and I’m ok with just maintaining it.",1
Is there a better program for someone like me that just wants to gain a moderate amount of strength and essentially just be healthy? Should I just keep continuing this 3x5 with cardio and stick with it long term?,1
"GZCLP or 5/3/1 For Beginners, both in the wiki, are fine programs if you have no particular aspirations to maximise strength or hypertrophy progress.",1
You can run 5/3/1 for a long time.,1
"Is there something wrong with my brain when I sleep? I sleep for around 3-4 hours then go use the bathroom, but once I am back in bed my brain is just hyperactive and won’t rest. Before bed I turn off my devices and read a book and I’m concerned if this will ruin my cut",1
"This isn't related to fitness. If you are having severe trouble sleeping, talk to a doctor.",1
Simple question about 5/3/1 for beginners:,1
I'm about to start this routine. There's a part in there where I need to set my initial Training Max for the main lifts (here).,1
"My question is: can I do this for all the main lifts on the same day? Like for all four main lifts? Or do I need to set the training max for Squat and Bench Press on a Monday, then set the Training Max for Deadlift and Overhead Press on a Wednesday?",1
Either is fine.,1
You could do it in one day before starting the program or just start the program but use the first week to find your TMs.,1
"Q: Is it safe to do cardio (steady state like 1h) OR strenght training fasted as first thing in the morning even with being in a deficit ? The thing is, im in caloric deficit and sometimes i just have to do cardio or training first thing in the morning (because of zero time through the day, i cant afford to eat before and wait) so lets say wake up, drink water, coffee, then go training and after my training / cardio have normal meal ? Is there any posibility of mucle loss ? Ty",1

"I have a wrist injury in my left hand, has nothing to do with lifting weights I've had it beforehand. Is there a good work around for bicep curls and solid middle delt exercises that don't require my hand to go into supination?  Rope hammer curls seem alright for me. I was thinking maybe straight bar would be good too. Any ideas or thoughts is appreciated. I only have the pain when I twist my wrist and it's on the left side. Thankfully I am unaffected when benching",1
Rule 5. Ask a doctor.,1
"I tried that, I am looking for a orthopedic to see whether I can fix it",1
I would work with them instead of strangers on the internet.,1
"I'm looking to invest in some home equipment. For cardio I have it narrowed down to either a rowing machine or elliptical. I've used ellipticals in the past and they are typically my preferred method of cardio, however I've seen that rowing machines can be more effective in overall cals burned. If I've never properly used a rowing machine before, is it easy to learn proper technique and worth it over an elliptical? And for either machine, what's a good brand to look at for a smaller footprint and best bang for your buck?",1
My general goals right now (30M) are conditioning/wellness and fat loss with some upper body strength improvement. I've already started cal/macro tracking to start fixing my diet.,1
"It’s not hard to learn the proper technique for rowing, but it is important to take the time to do so. Concept2 has some videos that will help. A lot of people pick it up their first session, some might need a little more time. Bottom line I wouldn’t let the learning curve stop you from choosing a rower if you’re leaning toward one.",1
"Ellipticals are more popular with people who do a lot of low intensity, longer workouts. Rowers are great for interval work. Each machine can do both, of course.",1
Concept2 is the good brand for rowers. I don’t know much about home ellipticals but I bet r/homegym would have some advice.,1
Personally I look on Craigslist/FB marketplace and choose whatever machine is cheap/free haha. Found some crazy deals that way.,1
"I adapted to rowing machine pretty fast. Personally I prefer elliptical, but both work fine.",1
So what's the nicest way to break up with your super nice gym owner?,1
I've been going to this little boutique gym for a few years now which has worked fine but I'm switching up my split this year which requires me to use a MUCH larger 24 hour gym in order to get my stuff done. It's awkward because he's a really supportive guy but I just need more equipment to play with in order to achieve my goals this year. Help me not make it awkward please I suck at this.,1
Tell him exactly that. You need a different gym for your goals right now and may be back,1

"Focus on building a habit, the results will follow.",1
It's important to make both goals on efforts aka process goals (I will work out three times a week) in addition to performance (I will run this much by this month in this much time).,1
"I would say, in the first three months, only focus on the process goals. Put good processes in place, then optimize them.",1
100%. Process goals and habit-forming is the most important thing.,1
"The kitchen will be the most valuable input to shedding those initial pounds.  It takes a bit of effort, but it's worth your time to track calories for an entire day to both quantify and get a rough feel for your what you're taking in.  Some people track daily while others are able to go off of rough feel.  With that calorie number in mind, you want to adjust the total down so you're eating in a calorie deficit (reducing calories by extreme amounts is stressful on your body as well).",1
Finding foods high in protein ensures you're staying full between meals.  As you become more knowledgable about nutrition you can decide if you care enough to balance proteins/fats/carbs to accelerate your fitness journey.,1
"Drinking sufficient water throughout the day helps manage hunger and satiation.  It's not that you're replacing food with water, but when you're hydrated, you're body will be able to better recognize hunger levels.  Many people unintentionally confuse hunger with dehydration.",1
"When it comes to exercise, the most important aspect when you start is finding a routine you ENJOY.  This will be key to consistency.  After you've established a routine, you can eventually shift your focus to optimizing and tailoring your workouts to your goals.  As others have mentioned, the wiki here has a wide array of workouts ranging from beginner to advanced.",1
Weights. Cardio. Balanced and healthy diet.,1
You're gonna see pounds fly off,1
"Not a question, just an observation. I had started doing below parallel squats and had been having  a lot of knee soreness for two days afterward. Friday I went back to my old of squatting to, but not below, parallel, and the soreness is gone. I figure either my form was off or deep squats are inherently harder on the knees.",1
You're just not used to working in that ROM. New stimulus causes soreness not good stimulus or bad one. You might want to start with a little less load and progress back up. But deep squats are not inherently riskier or damaging or worse for your knees,1
"How can I make time for exercise, university, and work?",1
"I started a home routine about a month ago because the holidays started and so far everything has been uphill, I spend about one hour doing exercise, but I'm starting to wonder what I'll do once my university classes start.",1
"I don't live particularly close to campus, I have to wake up quite early in the morning and a round trip is about three hours long so I lose a lot of my time commuting. As for work, I work from home so it's not that big of a deal, but when test season starts I'm afraid I won't have enough time for exercise and the rest of responsibilities.",1
"With this in mind, I'm not looking to grow much more muscle but I do want to maintain what I've formed so far. What do you recommend to do?",1
"I am in a similar position! I work full time (not from home) and go to college full time. I also go to the gym about 4x a week for 1-1.5 hours. I wake up early and get home late on gym nights, but I don’t have kids and am okay with not having a lot of time at home on gym nights. I do my homework mostly on the weekends and during my one hour lunch break at work. Sometimes during the semester, I only go to the gym 3x/week and that’s okay. Basically I just made a routine and stuck to it. You get used to not having extra free time, and personally I don’t mind it because I’m doing things I enjoy rather than having free time where I’d probably just watch TV anyway. I was intimidated by the busy schedule at first but found once I’m I a routine, it’s easy to keep going and I actually enjoy being busy and productive!",1
"20 year old male, 5’10 200lbs. I’m eating at a 500 calorie deficit but not seeing much change in weight, over the last week its fluctuated at a 0.2 higher or lower change. I lift weights 5 days a week and try to get 160-170 grams of protein a day. Could it be because I’m putting on muscle while losing body fat? (I’m fairly new to the gym) I use MyFitnessPal and a food scale so I know I’m not wrong with my tracking. Any advice?",1
"you are at maintenance, not a deficit. reduce by another 200-500 calories and reassess.",1
I’m eating at a 500 calorie deficit but not seeing much change in weight,1
Then you're not eating at a 500 calorie deficit.,1
"Anything you calculate is just a starting estimate. By being consistent in tracking both your calories and your weight, you get to find out what your actual energy expenditure is. If you're not gaining or losing weight, then you're eating at around maintenance, and should adjust nutrition/activity levels accordingly to reach your goals.",1
"Keep in mind that weight fluctuates wildly. I generally weigh myself at a consistent time, and use a rolling 5-day average.",1
"You may not be wrong in your tracking, but how do you know it’s a 500 calorie deficit?",1
Reduce your calories.,1
Any tips on how to perfect hip hinge especially for deadlifts?,1
"I have difficulty keeping my back straight and getting deep when hinging at the hips. I don’t know how much is psychological and how much is due to weakness, tightness or imbalance. My hamstrings are definitely tight, not sure about the rest of the body.",1
Is there a particular mobility routine/muscle group I should try to supplement and strengthen my deadlifts and good mornings?,1
Post a form check.,1
Otherwise doing basic hamstring stretches and deadlift will help.,1
You asked this earlier.,1
"The problem with just trying to lose weight until you don't have visible fat is that you likely will never hit that goal and be healthy WITHOUT having built up some muscle mass. Adding muscle to your frame will also probably cause you to look less like you have wide hips. And I know your goal is skinny and healthy, but you still need muscle mass on you. You don't become big and bulky overnight. Also, for your health, don't try and be super skinny. A goal to be lean and athletic looking is much better. And likely much more physically attractive to other people if that matters to you.",1
"At your current size, you could easily bulk up 20lbs and still be healthy weight wise. Find a solid routine from the wiki, eat at like 180g of protein a day, be in a slight calorie surplus (300-500 over, so like half a pound to a pound a week gain), and be consistent. After you've hit 200lbs, cut back your calories and start losing weight. You could probably hit 180lbs again and you'll be an entirely different man if youve put the hard work in.",1
"Put some thought into how you would structure your routines. For example, running in the morning before breakfast helps lose weight because your body looks into fat stores for energy.",1
You should also look into how many calories you should he eating and if you want to eat a surplus or a deficit.,1
Weight training definitely helps burn calories while building muscle,1
But a bigger part of weight loss is dieting. I recommend doing research on this as im definitley not an expert and these are just examples of methods people use to lose weight.,1
How long do the New Year's hordes usually take to disperse in your experience? I was not prepared. I went in New Year's day and there was like no one there... a few days later it is a mad house like I have never seen there before lmao,1
Varies on the year and the gym,1
Usually it doesn’t last more than a month or so by me,1
Is this fat or skinny fat?,1
Bit confused atm and not sure what to do.,1

"I can't get into the only gym near me, 5 months waiting list and extremely expensive, I have weights at home (barbell and dumbbells) but I don't have the sufficient weight for doing certain exercises.",1
"For bench presses I have increase reps, would I still see benefits or would they be minimal?",1
For legs I also do 30 minute jogging up and down hill everyday to make up for the lost in weights would it be better to increase the jogging workout so I get a overall better exercise on my lower body?,1
Edit: my alternative would be to lower the weights so my upper body is getting a lot less exercise what should more or less equal it out and end of Feb buy additional plates to increase the weight,1
Edit2: New to this so I'm seeing pretty great gains over the course of the last 4 weeks but of course this is mainly on my upper body.,1
What's stopping you from buying plates now?,1
"More reps and more sets is the best you can do if you can't increase the weight any more. You could always rig up some weight depending on how much you need to add. Hanging a 5lb bag of sugar off the bar on each side is a cheap and easy idea. Not optimal, but an idea. Or gallon water jugs in a very sturdy bag (or double/triple bagged). Also you could work on incline/decline press to change things up.",1
Running would not work your legs the same as weights. Running is cardio. You could try single legged work.,1
"To answer what wasn't already, the effective rep range for hypotrophy is 6-30, so until you get to 30 reps on your maxed out bench you are still doing good progressive overload.",1
"But take it with a grain of salt as it does vary depending on the individual, but as long as it's the muscle that is failing and not cardio, then you're fine.",1
"That seems to be good then, I'm hitting 15 reps and doing 5 sets for bench and around 20 to 25 for legs (last set I push more) even if taken with a grain of salt I'm still within that range.",1
Thanks for the info!,1
"Is it recommended that I count calories or at least macros to lose weight? I’ve heard a quote, “that which gets measured, gets managed”. How true is this of weight loss?",1
"If you're not losing weight, then yes. If you're losing weight, then whatever you're doing is working.",1
You need to be eating less than your body uses.  The only way to be sure is to track them.,1
"That said, many people successfully lose weight just by eating less, eating healthier foods, cutting out snacking, cutting out sugar drinks, etc., without ever tracking. Whatever works for you is fine.  But if what you're doing isn't working, i would suggest choose a new strategy.",1
I am curious on what method people use for progressive overload.My current method ( for example with Squats): I start with a load that I can exactly do 6 rep for failure (If I can't reach 6 I reduce load).I work with that weight until I can do 12 of them then increase my load to where I can again do 6.,1
I do 4 set (moving a set further only when I reach 12).,1
So far it looks alright but I wanted to know how other people do and if what I'm doing is good !,1
Most people pick a program and do what it says,1
To give you the quick and dirty how to progressive overload.,1
select a rep range for the exercise.This will differ from person to person. Personally i do 5-8 for most compound and 8-12 for most isolation exercises.,1
"Pick a weight and do the exerciseFrom here you either hit below, in or over (top of rep range also counts as over) your rep range. Then you need to do the following next time you're in the gym and doing that exact same set",1
"Below: lower the weight by 1 level (depends on the exercise, but generally the lowest amount of weight that can be added to that lift)",1
In: Do the same weight,1
Over: increase the weight by 1 level,1
"If all your sets were the exact same reps or lower than last time, add 1 more set for that session.",1
"Are you just doing those curls? If yes, go follow a proper program because just doing curls isn't gonna do much.",1
"For your grip issue, maybe using straps can help you out here.",1
"Wait so you’re doing 80 bicep curls, then 80 hammer curls?",1
If so please stop you will hurt yourself. Find a workout plan you like and follow it.,1
"Never had gyno or puffy nipples before, but for last 6 months my lower chest is just so puffy and pokes out/looks like a mountain.",1
"I am lean all over, so can't tell what foods are giving me puffy nipples. Is it stress, some diet, hormone problem?",1
"I am lean all over,",1
"How lean? Like, can you see your six pack in detail? Normally the easiest solution is to lose fat. If you think you have a hormone problem you can talk to a doctor/get a test.",1
If you enjoy it I’d stick with it,1
"I would probably start adding a day of full body weight training in there if you’re that worried, but in reality half a pound of muscle is a reasonable margin of error like the other guy said.",1
I also lost half a pound of muscle,1
That is definitely within the margin of error. Don't worry about that.,1
"If you want to lose fat, lose weight. The classes probably aren't the best for building muscle, but they won't prevent you from losing fat and likely they are enough to preserve muscle while you lose fat.",1
"First, please realize that DEXA scans aren't perfect. They do have a relatively large margin of error, which means that the numbers you were shown aren't entirely accurate.",1
"If you want to build or keep muscle, follow a solid lifting program. There are some in the wiki to choose from. There is no reason to cut back on the classes if you enjoy them, however. Weight loss comes down to diet, but exercise is great in any form.",1
What would you say is the best exercise of these for shoulder development?,1
Barbell OHP,1
standing dumbbell shoulder press,1
Seated dumbbell shoulder press(back supported),1
Smith machine OHP,1
The one you enjoy doing the most or works best for you.  There are advantages to each.,1
They are all variations of a similar movement through a similar plane.  I prefer barbell OHP.  Others seated dumb bell.  I hate the Smith Machine and for others it is there go to for hypertrophy work.  There will be a different answer person to person.,1
"There is also a benefit to rotating through variations, you don't have to do only one.  I would also throw in side lateral raises.  Front raises are good for additional volume and do not neglect the rear delts for shoulder development.",1
"from the sound of it, you go to the gym but sort of randomly do machines and exercises? if so, a structured program with progressive overload is what you need. the wiki has several.",1
That’s not really it at all! I do an every other day mix! But I’ll look into a more rigorous scheduled routine for lifting maybe. Thanks!,1
"Sleep and getting enough calories are both very important, and 30 is not old. You don't need to exercise 7 days a week to get results (though I understand you're doing a mix of cardio and strength), so that's not the issue. What's your routine?",1
"I try to do every other day. Cardio one day, then strength training the next. I split training days up, not doing a whole body workout. Some weeks I do more cardio than anything. It’s just easier and I don’t have to think about it. I did workout with a friend who is big into CrossFit for a while, and I try to follow a similar program that we were doing. Except she didn’t mix cardio at all. I’m not complaining, I’m grateful that I’m able to get up and move! I just am not all that enthused with all the flab lol",1
"You'd be better off following a good workout routine. You gotta progress with weights as well and don't be afraid to lift heavy. Not saying you are, but Ive seen tons of women in my gym go and wave around 10lbs dumbbells for a bit and call it good .... For months. If you're looking to build some muscle, you definitely gotta do more than that.",1
"Macro wise, protein is the most important. As long as you're getting a minimal amount of fat in (for hormone production), it really doesn't matter how much fat and how many carbs. Don't stress about those. Personally, my overall carb intake is low, but my carbs mostly come from fruits and veggies, I rarely eat bread, pasta, cereal, etc (and of course try and limit sweets.",1
"Total calories matters a bit more. If you more or less maintain weight, you'll have the slowest time at building muscle. If you bulk/cut, you'll more effectively gain muscle and more effectively cut off fat.",1
"You're only 30, that's not old yet! (28F here... No kids tho sadly!)",1
What is the gel-like substance that prevents muscle pain after intense exercise?,1
"I had a very intense biking session years ago with a friend, and by the end I was expecting a week of muscle pain ahead. When I got home my roommate gave me a packet of gel-like substance and told me to rub it on my legs. I gave it a try without expecting much but surprisingly enough my legs felt completely fine the next day. I knew the gel had done its job because the parts where I didn't rub it (glutes) hurt as much as I expected. Unfortunately I forgot to ask her what the gel was, and since then no one I asked knew what I was talking about, so I figured maybe someone here will.",1
Thanks in advance!,1
Just wanted some feedback on the chest/triceps and shoulder/abs regiment I was doing.,1
"I usually rest 1 minute between sets, and 2-3 minutes between different machines.",1
For the chest/triceps day,1
Assisted Tricep Dips (around 60 lbs assist) 12 reps x 3 sets,1
Dumbbell Bench: 25 lbs at 12 reps x 3 sets,1
Tricep Pull down: 30 lb 12x3 sets,1
Chest Press: 25 lb  10x3 sets,1
"I start with some dips since I heard that compound exercises were good to do first, then I swap between the chest and triceps. I'm avoiding the barbell since I don't have a spotter, and there isn't a smith machine in my gym.",1
For the shoulder/abs regiment,1
Military // Barbell Standing press: Just the bar @ 10x3,1
Planks 1 minute x 3,1
Shoulder Lateral Raises 12.5 lbs 8 x 3,1
Cable Crunch 70 lbs 12 x 3,1
Seated Barbell Press Seated Dumbbell Press 20 lbs 10x3,1
Any feedback would be appreciated.,1
Seems like alot of random things when you could just do a recommended routine from the wiki.,1
"Except I work an inconsistent work schedule working 12 hours, so I wouldn't be able to properly manage rest days, as some days I wouldn't be able to go to the gym.",1
So I would have to modify the recommended routines anyway.,1
"Based on recommendations I have received on this sub, I blocked off days to focus on specific muscle groups to let my other groups rest even if i go to the gym back to back, and I go to the gym every day I'm off work.",1
It's a bit difficult to adhere to some of the wiki recommendations with my schedule,1
Nothing in that reply precludes you from doing a routine.  You can do any template and forget the days on it and just do the next day each time you're in the gym.,1
Wouldn't varying periods of rest days screw up the schedule?,1
Basically I would work out less in that paradigm.,1
"Because the days I work I can't lift. And on the days I have off, I would have rest days according to a schedule, so I would lift even less.",1
"Right now I lift every off day focusing on different muscle groups, then cardio on my work days.",1
I haven’t hit my carbs target but I’m not hungry. If I eat them is it just a waste of calories?,1
"If you need the calories, sure, eat them. If not, don't bother about hitting carb targets unless you're trying to optimize something. Carbs are like the least important macro. Protein and fat are absolutely necessary. Whatever carb you have eaten today is probably enough",1
Well I’m cutting so this is technically a bonus right?,1
Why don't you just try it for yourself?,1
Cause I don't wanna puke :(,1

Should I add/delete any exercises from this routine? I have been doing this routine for a month only,1
"Currently I am doing strength workout on Sundays (Push)/Tuesdays (Pull)/Thursday (Legs) and C25K on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. Should I change my routine so I do strength training 6 days/week and do c25k after workout, or the current alternate day routine is fine?",1
Any other helpful tips?,1
Thank You!!,1
"so for your first goal, eating less is the answer.  this leaves gaining strength as your workout related goal.  this is not a strength program, your just doing a bunch of accessory lifts.  I'd look into 5/3/1 for beginners or gzclp.  gzclp just got a fancy new spreadsheet that has its own post here so that'd be fun.",1
Surely! Will look into it,1
"link to new gzclp spreadsheet , legit cannot believe this guy does that for free.  a real mensch.",1
r/fitness officially endorsed routines are worth looking at.  most of them are more strength focused (i.e. have the big 3 lifts with a high percentage of your max as working sets) than your posted routine.,1
"High Intensity Cardio combined with some resistance training, e.g. Aggressive Tire Flipping makes me sweat buckets and always leaves my head slightly dizzy for 2 mins, is this normal perhaps?",1
How do you effectively isolate the bicep during curls? I feel like my forearms end up helping and they end up sore after.,1
"Been lifting casually for a while, but I've started to take it a little more serious and only just noticed this forearm thing recently. Any input would be highly appreciated.",1
"your forearms are sore because they are gripping the weight, thats fine. your shoulders may be helping though, and you can fix that by keeping your shoulders back and/or using things like a preacher pad for support",1
"What helped for me was adjusting my grip slightly and not doing curls right after my back training, but instead having a separate day for my arms. There are also other form adjustments that can be made or just different choice of exercises for the bicep could also solve the problem. Hope that helps",1
What's a good workout to get rid of love handles?,1
fork putdowns,1
Don't forget the plate pushaways,1

Anything that creates a calorie deficit,1
Plate pushaways and fork putdowns,1
Any recommended program in the wiki while on a cut,1
See wiki -> recommended routines,1
I’ve started a 4 month block of marathon training ahead of April. I’ve been gymming 5 days a week over last year (PPLPP).,1
Naturally I’m going to have to reduce my gym/lifting load because I’m running 5 days week (following a programme).,1
"I’m content with what I’m going to do in the gym (~3-4 days a week,  likely 3) with mainly Push, Pull, Upper (the odd leg exercise intertwined depending on where I am in the programme).",1
Anyone seen any interesting body transformations when combining weight lifting and >25-40miles a week running?,1
I’m clueless how I’ll look - I’m hoping to treat the initial portion as a very mild cut (bulked before Christmas).,1
During peak mileage weeks i got noticeably Leander and thinner lol. Once you get to 40+ mpw the cumulative fatigue is real. Lift what you can when you can.,1
"Also highly recommend doing lower body strength and mobility to balance the running load. RDLs, lunges, and light weight or body squats can REALLY help your glutes, hip flexors, and lower core",1
"You don't neccessarily become weaker after just two weeks, you probably didn't even lose any muscle mass. You are just slightly detrained. You'll probably hit your weights in 1 or 2 squat sessions again.",1
"I take double the amount of the time I have been out but its different for every person and every ailment. You'll notice soon enough, just start at the 130 again :)",1
Do I need to do ab exercises for my abs to show or are compounds enough? I already know bf% is important but what else is necessary?,1
If you want big abs you should train them directly.,1
"If you want bigger and, train them more.",1
I usually finish all my lifts and then do a few sets of abs at the end of my workout with what gas I have left in the tank.,1
Lowering body fat is the most important factor to show abs. Everyone has them. Most can't show them.,1
Abs are made in the gym like all muscles. They are revealed in the kitchen - just like any other muscle.,1
How to brace myself for overhead (when I try to lift from a rack instead of the floor I can barely do half as much) and any form tips if the middle of my back hurts when doing them?,1
Squeeze your glutes HARD and brace your core and lats,1
Mid-back pain went away for me when I switched to dumbbells only for OHP,1
"Hypothetical question here. Say your target calories is 2700 and you’re at 2500, you just finished work and you wouldn’t mind a beer or 2, putting you up to 2700cal. Alcohol inepts protein synthesis obviously but is getting that last 200 cal from alcohol somehow emptier than eating that 200cal?",1
Personally if you feel you've earned the beer then enjoy it. It's not worth worrying over the tiny details when average over a month or even a week then they're irrelevant.,1
"Once In a while beer, you'll be fine. It's not optimal, but you're allowed to live a little. Now if this becomes a regular occurrence, you probably should just grab a handful of nuts instead",1
"I don't know if it's much related and worth asking here, but I decided to get a bike, any tips on how to choose the bike? Other than it being within budget, ofc",1
Like outdoor bike? Depends on where you are planning to ride it.,1
Want to ride rugged trails - mountain bike.,1
Gonna just ride on the streets - road bike,1
"Want to do so light off roading (gravel trails, etc) while still riding some on pavement - gravel bike, hybrid bike, cyclocross bike",1
"Frame materials will vary the cost too. Steel will be heavy, but durable. Aluminum is lighter, kinda in the middle as I understand for durability. Carbon fiber is light but a bad hit and your frame is done, hard or impossible to repair, and expensive.",1
"Handle bars, seat and pedals can all be removed and replaced with different ones, so if you don't like something there, it's changeable. You can also adjust the stem length (how far the handle bars are pushed out in front) so conside that with how a bike feels to ride. Also, highly encourage you to look up bike fitting videos so you can get an idea of where you're supposed to be on a bike so you can buy a frame that fits! Sometimes it may be awkward, for example my height says a medium frame, but my legs are so long that a large frame works. A professional bike fitter told me I could go either way but with a large, I'd be reaching more, with a medium, I'd be higher off the center of gravity.",1
Find a bike store where they can actually talk to you about what your wants/needs are and their recommendations.  Local bike stores are generally an awesome place to get info and fitted for a bike.,1
Silly question as a somewhat beginner haha but how do you choose the right program? I’ve been doing starting strength but haven’t heard great things about it and was wondering if there was a better option?,1
Also is preworkout “necessary” for lifting? I used to take it but stopped and am unsure whether I should start taking it again to boost my energy :),1
"Pick one from the wiki, which looks fun and fits your schedule.",1
Preworkout isn't necessary. If you just want the energy boost anything with caffeine will help.,1
"This is gonna be a lot of trial and error on your part. You’ll start some programs you hate, and some that you’ll love for years from now.",1
"The best workout you can do is the one you keep doing. If you like this program stay on it for 6-8 weeks, make sure you are documenting progress (pics, weight, if possible DEXA) and reflect in a couple months on if it’s doing what you hoped.",1
What type of tape would I use to wrap around my barbell for grip? I have a crappy barbell because its the only one I could get 7 ft standard size and has crap knurling that is so far spaced so when I do OHP there is no knurling where my hands are. I want to wrap some tape or something to get grip. Which tape should I use?,1
"I'm looking to switch to Altras, as they're recommended for people with bunions due to the wide toe box.",1
"I'd be switching from neutral, springy shoes. Mostly road running, some treadmill.",1
"Can anyone recommend which model of Altra, or a different brand?",1
"I’d go to a running store and get sized. You can try on multiple brands that way. You’ll pay slightly more for the shoes, but then you’ll know it’s a good fit and can buy subsequent pairs online.",1
I don't mind paying for decent shoes.,1
"I usually wear Brooks, have done for years, with no issues til the last 6 weeks or so.",1
"After doing my back exercises(Lat pulldown, T-bar row, and half kneeling lat pulldown) My elbows get incredibly stiff, and i can’t hold my arm straight, my elbow simply doesnt allow it. Its the inner part of the elbow btw.",1
My forearms also get very veiny and big. Any suggestions on how to avoid this?,1
Im still trying to wrap my head around stamina vs endurance Can anyone explain to me how I could train both? For example could I do : distance running for endurance and high intensity interval for stamina?,1
"To me, stamina and endurance are similar enough that trying to differentiate them seems silly.",1
Why/how are you making them separate?,1
There is no difference in the way you’re using the terms.  Occasionally people refer to “endurance” as how many reps one can do of a particular exercise before failure.  For example- 20 reps of 45 barbell curls before failing.  But for cardio (your example) both “endurance” and “stamina” mean essentially the same thing.,1
"I really need to get some elbow and knee sleeves. Maybe also a pair of wraps/something with compression also. So basically a pair strictly for joint support and maybe something separate to lift more not technically raw.

Preferably not written by a PF trainer on tnation getting paid or anything like that. Thanks",1

I got tennis elbow which is effecting my upper body routine. I know rest is needed and doing all the rehab I can. Should I just train legs 2-3 time a week with core and cardio and skip upper body until 100% or train upper body with restricted movements and anything that triggers the pain?,1

Almost all begnner workout programms are Fullbody MWF types.,1
"What will change if I break the fullbody workout (Let's say the RR) into two parts, and do one half on Monday, Wed, Fri, and the other half on Tue, Thu, Sat?",1
"Instead of working out for 40 mins three times a week, I would be working out for 20 min 6 times a week. The rest would ALL be the same.",1
"What difference would it make? If it will not make any significant difference, then why aretn't beginnger workouts designed like this?",1
"It's fine to split it. For hypertrophy the specific split doesn't matter that much, if weekly volume is equal.",1
Imo it's easier if you only have to go to the gym 3 days per week instead of 6.,1
There are beginner workouts in the wiki that are designed for 6 days e.g. the reddit ppl.,1
"What difference would it make? If it will not make any significant difference, then why aretn't beginnger workouts designed like this?",1
It doesn't make a difference. It isn't more common because it is less convenient for most people to go to the gym 6x for only 20 minutes each. That is really short and for me it wouldn't be worth the drive.,1
"Perfect! This is the kind of answer I was looking... because for me, I am trying to build an exercise habit.. and for me, doing something small but everyday is more convenient than doing something medium but on alternate days. I already go to the park in the morning!",1
Thanks!,1
if you're doing the same work probably the 6 day just because you'd likely be able to lift more weight better rested.  but you'd likely have similar results,1
Could anyone explain to me how to properly warm-up?,1
"The way I do it now is that when I have to do say a benchpress with my max weight of 70kg, I do 20 reps on empty bar, 10 reps on 20kg, 8 reps on 40kg, 6 reps on 50kg and then I finally go to 5 reps on 70kg. I wait 2-3 min between each one, which means that the whole exercise sometimes takes me like 30-40 min and I spend over 2 hours in the gym.",1
"I'm on a real tight schedule right now, so I want to spend max hour and a half there. How do I do it guys? Do I warm up prior to every exercise or just the main compound one of the day? And how long is the warm-up?",1
Just pyramid up into the working weight of your first set. You don’t need to rest 2-3 minutes between warmup sets. I only rest as long as it takes to add plates.,1
Here’s an example:,1
135x10 -> 225x5 -> 275x3 -> first working set of 315.,1
Your warmup is just about priming you. It should be ridiculously easy and untaxing.,1
"Edit: I’d only do this again if I was doing a drastically different exercise, like squats after bench press as an ex.",1
Do you ever do that powerlifting choreography for setting up the bench press where you put your feet on the bench and shove your knees up and forward before assuming the final pressing position?,1
"Is there any benefit to it? I've used it a few times, generally for top sets and it does make feel quite tight and prepared, but I find it unnecessary for lighter or warmup sets.",1
"Yes, I do it the same way I do. BTW the link you posted pretty much answers these questions",1
"I have a question about protein consumption. The wiki states that one should eat .8g protein per pound of body weight. But most of the sources that I am finding online suggest .8g protein per kg of body weight, which is significantly different. Which is a more correct starting point?",1

.8g per pound,1
"Is squat an easier exercise than barbell row? I can do 40kg squats for 15 reps 4 sets with some effort, I cannot do barbell bent over row for 15 reps with proper form.",1
Literally two totally different muscle groups my guy.,1
This is a weird question to be honest. They are entirely different exercises so neither is “easier” than the other. I bet you could do bent row for 15 reps with proper form if you drop the weight a bit,1
"Most people can squat more than they can row, if that's what you're asking. That's primarily due to the difference in muscle groups though.. your upper body isnt as strong as your lower body, generally.",1
Yes you should be able to do quite a lot more weight for squat than barbell row.,1
I've often heard people say that your barbell row should be similar to your bench press in terms of weight.,1
A common ratio of your bench press to squat would be 225lbs Bench to a 315lb squat which gives you an idea of the ratio.,1

I finally decided to change my diet for the sake of my future health this semester (sticking to high protein low processed foods + added sugars.) Will my physique drastically change as a result of this, despite already having decent tone most likely due to fast metabolism + genetics?",1

You're more likely to see perceptible changes in performance and energy levels.,1

Any tips for making Zercher carry suck less on the elbow crook apart from being less of a wimp?,1
Put your knee sleeves on your elbows. Otherwise you’ll just get used to it over time. Play with arm position (eg hands clasped vs parallel).,1
It’ll never be comfy but over time it will bother you less.,1
"Just more experience with them, you'll get used to them pretty quickly",1

"It doesn’t matter, keep track of different machines separately.",1
"The number is just for your reference. You can’t compare numbers between different brands of machines, since every machine will offer different resistance based on variances in construction.",1

"I do boxing as a workout. But I want abs and I feel like I’m not doing enough ab workouts. Any recommendations for ab workouts that doesn’t require any equipment? Im a female, 5’6, and I weight about 130 lbs.",1
Revealing your abs is going to come down more to diet than exercise.  You're already at a disadvantage since it's harder for women to have a 6 pack.  You'll have to get to a low enough bf %.,1
"Abs are all about diet and bodyfat percentage. Exercises can help once you're low enough though: cruches, side twists, oblique exercises, planks, etc.",1
"As the other people said, making abs show is almost all about body fat and where you carry it.  I know you said no equipment but if you are at a boxing gym they almost certainly have a rope skipping platform and ropes.  It is great for burning and learning new jumps is a great way to avoid being board.  Plus, it will help a lot with your footwork.",1
"I don't agree, for a woman, making your abs show through diet is going to result in being extremely underweight. Women need to really focus on hypertrophy to get large enough abs to be visible at a healthy body fat percentage.",1

Any tips on diets/recipes or workouts would be appreciated cause I’m tired of being fat.",1
"Hey man, I was in a similar situation when I was around your age and I know how frustrating it can be to not be able to control your own diet. I think the best thing to do is to talk to your dad about wanting to eat healthier and see if he could help you achieve your goals. If that doesn’t work out, then the next best thing probably is to get into portion control, although it can be hard. If you eat less of the same stuff everyday, you will lose weight.",1
"Also, I personally think it’s not the best idea to set a time limit to your weight goals. 65 lbs in 5-6 months is alot and it can be frustrating/demotivating to not reach your goals. Losing weight/staying fit is ultimately a lifestyle change and I personally think it would be wiser to take a slower approach so you can actually stick to a sustainable lifestyle instead of going on a mega diet and a massive change over a short time.",1
"Consistency is king. Nothing will beat consistency. Try to eat a little better everyday and workout consistently and you will get there. You aren’t racing anyone and there is no time limit. If you don’t have access to a gym, r/bodyweightfitness has some great resources for routines that require minimum set up.",1
You will not make progress if you put so much of the diet responsibility on your dad.,1
Can you offer to cook the meals for him and yourself? Then you can make healthy food and control your diet much more.,1
"No I’m not saying it’s his fault I can tell him not to bring me any food back, he offers to buy me whatever from the store but i have no idea what a healthy diet would be (clearly) that’s why I’m asking for any advice on what to get",1
"To clarify, I said responsibility - not fault! It's a very common problem for people living with parents (I had the same problem, and ended up cooking our meals so I could manage nutrition).",1
"Healthy diets are all about whole foods: meats, veggies, grains. Chicken breast, ground turkey, broccoli, carrots, rice, potatoes, etc. For example, almost all my meals are some base carb (rice, potato) + protein (chicken, salmon, tempeh) and a ton of veggies (broccoli, bok choy, spinach).",1

Will I build lots of core strength by doing the main compound lifts regularly?,1
"You should. If that's not enough, feel free to add some core exercise.",1
"Simple answer, yes",1
Check out Dr. Mike Israetel on abs hypertrophy: https://youtu.be/3J4ZStmJuWQ,1
Maybe. You'll definitely build lots of core strength if you target it directly though.,1
"To an extent, depends on your definition of lots",1
Doing them single arm or single leg will be a big boost to it,1
What are some good exercises for upper back.,1
Rows and pullups.,1
"if it was my first time doing RDLs in a very long time, I'd feel super sore and tight the next day. if im used to it, I'd feel fine.",1
Depends on the intensity of the workout and how new you are to that movement.,1
I do not believe the desired result of any regular excersize would be an inability to walk.  You should feel tension and a stretch during the movement.  You typically should feel fatigue in your hamstrings and glutes. You may feel soreness but should not acute pain.,1
As a caveat you do not necessarily need to feel a muscle to work a muscle.  But I find with RDLs the stretch is a good indicator of proper depth and form being correct.,1
"Fatigue in the hamstrings, lower back & forearms.",1
"At what point should joint popping be a concern? I do pushups daily and I hear a popping noise from my shoulder on the way down. I also feel some tightness in my left elbow but rarely or never any pain. If you suggest taking a break, is there things I should do in the downtime to help or should I do zero activity? Would I know how long to take a break or would I have to wait until the noise stops?",1
As long as there’s no pain I wouldn’t stress it too much.,1
How do you all calculate your bf percentage?,1
At school we used a scale which said I was around 12%,1
At home I used a different scale which said around 23%,1
"In a online bf calculator it said 12%, but I only had to fill in my age, height, gender, waist and neck size, my thighs are quite big compared to the rest of my body, so there must also be a lot of fat there, which isn't included.",1
I don't think I'm either 12% or 23%,1
just look in the mirror and decide if you like how you look. does the actual number matter?,1
"I mean like if I want to lose fat, I atleast want to know how much fat I can actually lose",1
"I get where you're coming from - I've wanted to set a goal like ""10 more lbs until I'm 10% body fat and shredded!"" but it doesn't really work like that, even if you really knew what body fat % you're currently at. It's unknown how your body will look at certain body fat percentages because it completely depends on your body type and build.",1
Unless you do something like a water displacement test or a dexa scan (both of which have their issues) it’s literally just a guess,1
Would it be ok to do curls earlier in the day (say around noon) separate from my evening workouts?,1
Reason being I’m trying to cut down my time in the gym. I can easily do some curls at home while I’m working and not have to add time to my workouts.,1
"Yes, when you do most exercises actually matters very little.  I’ve seen people have success working out 3-4 times a day because that is what their schedule allowed.",1
"Who the peeps who do PPL, some exercises like Bench you do 5 x 5 and sometimes 3 x 8-12, do you only progress linear on the 5 x 5 or both?",1
"Linear on 5x5, double progression on 3x8. Work up to 3x12, increase the weight, and go back to 3x8.",1
"For arm isolation exercises, do you flex the bicep/tricep throughout the entire range of motion or only at peak contraction?",1
"Also, I get painless cracking/popping in my forearm/inner elbow when my elbow is fully bent during curls. If I stop just before completely bending my elbow it doesn’t crack/pop. Would stopping just short of complete elbow flexion take away from the exercise at all? Not looking for medical advice, more curious if this modification is not optimal.",1
"For arm isolation exercises, do you flex the bicep/tricep throughout the entire range of motion or only at peak contraction?",1
"Well, to lift the weight at all, you have to flex the muscle throughout the motion.",1
"If you mean consciously flex it more, that doesn't really matter.",1
"Also, I get painless cracking/popping in my forearm/inner elbow when my elbow is fully bent during curls. If I stop just before completely bending my elbow it doesn’t crack/pop. Would stopping just short of complete elbow flexion take away from the exercise at all? Not looking for medical advice, more curious if this modification is not optimal.",1
"As long as there's no pain or discomfort, joints that crack or pop aren't harmful. Go through the full range of motion.",1
Your muscles are contracting the entire range of motion. Some people say to flex at the very end of the movement but if you don't it won't ruin progress. Basically you don't need to overthink it at this point. I'd recommend looking more at your form for whatever exercises you're doing.,1
For your second question just do what you're comfortable with. Consistently getting in there and exercising over a long period of time will make the biggest difference. Range of motion does matter but if you're doing like 80-90% of the motion I wouldn't worry about it.,1
I can bench 60kg for 5 but I can't even move the 70kg (I tried the 70 at the end of my chest workout but that doesn't justify why I cant even move it),1

Is the 10kg jump that big? Cuz I don't feel that off a difference between 40 and 50,1
Is the 10kg jump that big?,1
"Yes, in this scenario it is significant.",1

What program are you on?,1
"I'm looking for a chest accessory to add after my barbell bench press. Is there a difference between dumbbell press and chest press machine? I've seen people recommend dumbbell press, but I find it hard to retract my scapula, which ends up putting unnecessary pressure on my shoulders.",1
"They are different. Dumbbell requires balance and stabilization, machine doesn't. But both are good chest exercises IMO.",1
I would say it depends on what you want out of it as an accessory.,1
The dumbbells have the most carry over to the bench press as they are a free weight exercise.,1
"The chest press can be loaded heavier which is better for hypertrophy, but also get you used to holding something heavy.",1
"Opinions welcomed. I work continentals,",1
This is currently working for me the past two weeks lifting every day adjusting the weight and rep range for how the body feels that day.,1

"Then I start from 1 again, each session usually takes an hour.",1
My lifts have been going up and I'm fairly certain I can do a 300 sumo next time I attempt to.  Am I doing enough to achieve my goal? I'd like to spend more time in the gym but it gives me no time for anything else even with meal prep.,1
"If you want to help ensure you reach your goal, scrap this routine and get on a proper program.",1
There are several good ones listed in the wiki linked above.,1
I recommend 531 for Beginners;,1
https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/,1
That’s not getting you a 500 pound deadlift,1
It’s not intended to.  It’s intended to get him on proper structured programming.  He needs to lift 300 before he lifts 500.,1
What's the longest anyone has had DOMs for?,1
I changed my programing to start the year and hit legs first up. Admittedly I had a few quiet weeks over Xmas but I'm five days on and only just starting to come right. Normally I'm quite happy to be hobbling around for a day or two but this has been brutal.,1
"5 days is rough. If I go a long time without hitting hamstrings directly with RDLs, the DOMS will be bad for 2-3 days and still noticeable on the 4th, so not out of the question. Just keep moving, getting blood flow to the area, drinking water, eating enough.",1
"Yeah, finally freed up enough to jump on the stationery bike yesterday. Got the blood flow going and it feels way better today. Think I'll leave legs for another day though. I'm no spring chicken so my age is probably a factor in the recovery time also.",1
"Tbh, you'll probably feel better if you work legs out again more often than not.",1
"Yeah, who am I kidding. Off to deadlift. Cant do cardio two days in a row!",1
"When I began training each muscle group twice pr week instead of once pr week, I was sore for about two weeks all over, and then I just stopped getting sore.",1
"I've found it intriguing how the change up in programing has made me so sore. I've been training close to three years 4-5 times a week. Program change and boom, sore  AF. Weirdly its not like it is any massive intensity or rep range change either. I'm sure i'll be used to it in a couple of weeks like you said.",1
Doing a PPL rest and repeat split. Is it fine if I do a few sets of as many pull ups as I can during the 3 days on?,1
Depends on what you mean by fine and how fatiguing pull ups are to you.,1
"The idea of inducing hypertrophy is that you break down the muscles and then while you're resting them they heal and become bigger. Therefore working the muscle while it is healing is not gonna build more muscle and might stunt the growth a bit, depending on how intense that is for you.",1
"If you're just playing around and doing pullups is easy for you, then you'll be fine and if you think it's fun then that is also fine, but it does risk slightly reducing your muscle growth.",1
"That is how it works as far as i know, but i could be wrong, so i recommend doing further research or wait for someone who knows for sure.",1
"Yeah you're right actually. I am going for hypertrophy, so I would need to rest my back muscles. Right now I can do 3 sets of 4, 3 and 2-3 pull ups.",1
"I saw in a PPL split in the wiki that said to do pull ups everyday except for Sunday's, so was curious if I could add that to the other PPL that in following. Thanks for the response tho!",1
"If you want you can put it on your pull days, since pull ups are a great exercise.",1
"The problem is if you can only do 4 pull ups (i can also only do 4-5 pull ups per set), then it's hard to progressively overload it, therefor it's hard progressing the exercise since adding weight doesn't make sense until you can hit a decent rep range.",1
"If you put them in your program i recommend going to failure and then do negative pull ups (jump up and then come down slow) until you hit some set reps total (so if you do less normal pull ups you do more negatives) and then finish with deadhang to failure as a set. That helped me a lot, but try out what works for you.",1
i can also only do 4-5 pull ups per set,1
That’s a solid indication that you should not be giving advice about pull ups.,1
"The problem is if you can only do 4 pull ups (i can also only do 4-5 pull ups per set), then it's hard to progressively overload it, therefor it's hard progressing the exercise since adding weight doesn't make sense until you can hit a decent rep range.",1
I think you need to brush up on your understanding of the term 'progressive overload'.,1
Why are you giving advice if you can only do 5 pull-ups at a time?,1
How much of an impact will adding 20 min to my current 30m workouts make to muscle growth and strength build if I’m focusing on compound movements in a full body 3x per week programme?,1
My strength numbers are poor due to some past injuries not letting me lift very heavy but I’ve resolved those now and getting back into a regular 3x a week routine. I’ve gone back to 5x5 to get my strength foundation up.,1
"I workout during my lunch breaks and I’ve found a gym that’s much closer that would cut the 10m walk there and back I have with my current gym, theoretically giving me an extra 20m per session.",1
It’s a lot more expensive though but I think it would be worth the extra time gained but only if my body is able to take advantage if that makes sense?,1
"I currently do AB style of A: Bench, Squat, Row and B: OHP Deadlift Chin-ups.",1
Thoughts?,1
Time is a poor metric to judge strength and hypertrophy training. It would depend on how much additional volume you fit into those 20 minutes.,1
I guess I’d be adding accessory work into my 5x5 so the volume would increase by maybe 2-3 exercises at 3x8?,1
Which sounds like it would make a difference as I type it out,1
Im curious to how calories work in a certain situation.,1
"Lets say Im on a cut and workout 3x a week (monday, wednesday, friday). Making saturday and sunday, two rest days in a row.",1
And lets say on sunday I wanna eat my monthly cheat meal.,1
Would it be best to have the cheat day on Monday since I dont train on Sunday and the day before? Will the food be better used on Monday since Im on a surplus on a cheat day?,1
It does not matter,1
"Doesn't really matter. Sunday maybe is fractionally better since your body will have time to process the food and get the energy from it, you'll likely feel a bit more perky on Monday.",1
"Stupid question, but if anyone has an Apple Watch, is it accurate in counting your calories burned during strength training? I started a “functional strength training” workout on my watch just to see what it would say and lifted (moderately intensely) for 2 hours today, and afterwards it said I burned close to 800 active calories and 900 total calories. Is this completely off or somewhat accurate?",1
It is not accurate.,1
Looking for an app that will tell me the next weight to use when I exceed the specified rep range for an exercise.,1
"Seems like a simple thing, but I haven't been able to find one that does this. All the apps I can find basically just provide a UI for entering in the exercise/weight/sets/reps by yourself. No automation at all.",1
Any that I've missed?,1
"I don't need an ""AI"" app that builds/adjusts a routine for me. I want to make the routine, just want the app to use basic arithmetic to adjust the weight based on the reps I did.",1
Would be willing to pay a few bucks one-time. Not interested in a subscription.,1
"I get what you mean, but i don't think there is an app that does it.",1
"Aplha progression is the app i use, and on that you can specify for each exercise how big increments you want to increase your lift by every time you exceed your rep range.",1
"So i have it set to cable flys go up in 1.25kg intervals, but bench goes up in 2.5kg intervals and dumbbels go up in 2kg intervals.",1
I think that is the closest to what you're looking for.,1
"edit: there is a subscription to the app, but you do not need to buy anything to access that feature i was talking about.",1
"Will give that one a try, thanks.",1
I simply add 5-10 lbs and log it in Google sheets.,1
That is program-dependent. Different programs have different progression schemes. Boostcamp is a good app with lots of programs and liftvault.com has tons of spreadsheets that are easy to use. The wiki also has tons of free programs and the Stronger By Science programs are especially good.,1
What's a proper way to warm up before starting lifting weights ? What should I do ? I'm a beginner.,1
Depends on what lift you're doing.,1
It's always good to warm up by doing the lift or exercise on a really low weight to get your body ready for that specific lift.,1
"Some of my routines are for bench i start with the bar and then work my way up. If you have shoulder discomfort, you can use a band or stick, grab it and go over your head and behind the back a bunch, that has helped me.",1
For squat i start by putting on the bar and just got super deep for a couple of squats and then go low and sit there for a bit. Some people like dynamic stretching aswell for warming up and get the blood flowing.,1
Generally if you didn't walk or bike to the gym it's a good idea to just jump on a treadmill and get warm before you start lifting. Depending on who you are somewhere right before i start sweating is my ideal point to start working out.,1
How many warm up sets and reps should I do ? Is 5 good ?,1
That depends on the weight you use and is something highly personal.,1
Generally speaking the more weight you're lifting the more warm up sets you need to do.,1
"I don't think i do 5 warm up sets on any exercise, but if you deadlift like 5-6 plates then you could.",1
Can you give me an idea of how much lift on the exercises you're looking to warm up for?,1
"I'm hella weak ngl, I lift like 55 lbs on Squats and Bench press, and idk anymore on Deadlifts.",1
"Is 3 sets of warms up good? Like First set, 10 reps of very light weight, then 2nd set, 8 reps of light weight, and final set, 6 reps of moderate weight.",1
"If you squat and bench 55 lbs then there isn't a lot of room to warm up, as the bar itself is 45 lbs.",1
"I would probably warm up by doing the wooden stick for a bit on bench, or bodyweight squats for squat just to get into the movement.",1
Then the bar which is 10 lbs under what you normally do for like 5-6.Then i would start on your regular sets of 55 lbs for 10.,1
"You should not feel tired after a warm up set, at most you should feel your heartbeat increase a bit. The point of the warm up is to prepare for that movement and to some extent get the blood flowing to those muscles.",1
"Went to the gym and I became even more weaker, I can only squat 22 lbs for 6 reps max, damn",1
